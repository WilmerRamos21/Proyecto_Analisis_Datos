I acutally rediscovered it after 10 years of hiatus.
Its Not the Hobby per se that changed me.
After being stuck in temporary Work in IT For years i got Back into Tabletop Gaming with 2 Buddies. My Job Made me sick and depressed because i never Had any true Job security.

Than a Chance to Work Part time at my local Games Workshop opened Up. So with Backup from my wife i quit and did that.

One year later i got offerd the Chance to manage my own Store and did that For about 4 years.
I learned about Management, Customer care, de-escalstion and got more self-consiousness to the Point i acutally enjoyed my Job again and being able to fight Depression. And i Made Tons of new Friends and Connections.

Then i went Back into IT but due to my experience with managing my Store, customers, inventory etc. I was able to jump into a higher Position.
Now im managing the Mobile Devices, Users and Network for our Towns schools, working with the Mayor and other politicians to get our schools from digital wastelands to modern systems.

I forgot to say how I discovered it... With Bead Embroidery it was a book by Sherry Serafini and Heidi Kumli. I had been using beads in my belly dance costumes since 1988 and then got into bead weaving in the 90s. That bead embroidery book really changed how I approached making my costumes and making jewelry.

I found out about this new modern Mixed Media from paper craft companies - Stamperia, Mintay, Prima/Finnabair. The MxMd we did in college was boring by comparison! I use to use paint, collage & foils when I was in college... now I still use those along with resin/clay castings, die cuts, texture pastes - working on substrates that were never available to use back in the 80s - heavy black gessos, colorshifting paints... like I said, I feel like a kid in the candy store with all these mediums available now.",-0.022647527910685805,Negativo

Kishkumen7734,2022-02-19,"Battletech.  It's a table-top game played with miniatures and dice on a map.  Playing this game sharpened my number sense and vastly improved my mental math.    
It works like this:  
My 'mech (giant robot) walked 4 hexes.  The enemy 'mech moved six hexes into some light woods.  My gunnery skill is 4.  Add +1 because I walked.  Add +2 because the target moved 5 to 6 hexes.  The light woods adds another +1.  That's 8 total I have to meet or exceed with two six-sided dice.  But the target is medium range with the weapon I'm using, so I add another +2.  I have to roll a 10 or higher.

The target shoots back at me and adds +2 for running, +1 because I moved 4 hexes.  I'm at long range with his weapon so add another +4.  His gunnery skill is 4, so add all that together and he has to get an 11 or higher.

Once a shot hits, there's some damage rules and such, but adding up all these numbers and remembering who walked, who ran, where the trees are, the short, medium, and long ranges of weapons and then adding all this together improved my math ability more than school ever did.

My bf introduced me to pot when I was 17. I‚Äôm autistic and lived my entire life up until that point always feeling uncomfortable and anxious and overall just off. When I first got high I actually felt VERY comfortable in my body and I COULD EAT!!!! I always struggled with food so finally being able to eat until i was full ü§©ü§©ü§©. Oh and I could finally talk and carry a conversation like normal people do! I now start most of my days with a morning smoke while I feed the cats and watch them play.

I grew up with a mom that did a LOT of dog rescue (she now owns her own rescue dog transport business to take 30+ dogs to their furever homes twice a month. From Texas to Connecticut.) and with my autism I just really prefer hanging out with a fuzzy friend than with people. Animals also like me and warm up to me quickly. Anytime my mom got a foster that was pregnant or just really skidish and scared she‚Äôd keep them in my room. I‚Äôve had a litter of pups birthed onto my lap and dogs that would be sweet silly snuggle butts but only with me. 
I moved in with my bf when I was 17 and noticed a skinny female always hanging around the porch (Mama cat). Once I noticed her belly growing and realized she was pregnant I started putting food out for her. Since I provided a constant source of food she decided to give birth under the porch steps. My bfs mom found the kittens when they were old enough to be weened and we brought them inside. Kept 3 and sent the fourth to a foster who immediately adopted her on the first day lol. Well even after she had her kittens I kept giving her food because she seemed sweet enough to be tamed. Well all the food attracted the whole colony, especially pregnant mamas. My mom is friends with one of the few ladies that do cat rescue around here who owed her a favor and had her help me trap and fix a few. Most of the kittens that are born under our porch i socialize and send them up north with my mom to a rescue up there so the colony has stopped growing. Most of the males have left except for some of the grumpy old men and there is now only 2 females left to be fixed. One of the daughter of Mama cat who is kinda the oddball of her litter, all of her siblings were super sweet and friendly but she is absolutely feral. She runs up to me when she hears/sees me and meows at my feet and kinda pretends to rub on my legs without touching me and lets me know when she is pregnant or going into labor and calls me to her kittens so I can take care of them but she absolutely will NOT let me touch her.

fast forward to about a month into our new arrangement, and i had what i can only describe as a bit of a breakdown. i was clobbered with crippling anxiety and it was blinding. i had only experienced something similar after some trauma in my college years. i needed something to do with all this alone time. 
before we moved, my grandma had bought me a sewing machine for super cheap at an auction and it needed serious maintenance, so i tried to fix it. I sort of did, so i taught myself to sew and started making quilts. from there, i DIY-ed our first Christmas with all sorts of handmade things, got into community at church and started teaching others to sew from scratch, started a collection of sewing machines, new and old, and generally fell in love with making things by ""hand""
it i something i am forever thankful for. i started about nine years ago now and i have lost count of how many quilts i've made. i am currently about to start a baby quilt for a dear friend of mine, and i make my own clothing when i feel like wrestling with that. it is a joyous skill and i highly recommend",0.2083030303030303,Positivo

That was over a decade ago, and while running and I have had our ups and downs, it's gotten me through so much. Through personal illness, massive grief, when life is too busy, and when life is slow. While running obviously couldn't prevent the bad things, it so very much gave me the confidence and space to change my mindset, grow as a person, and learn to believe in myself after a childhood of being put down and being made to feel so small. I joke that it was my ""gateway sport"" - giving me the confidence (or delusions) to try all kinds of other activities, and discover nature in a new way, and allow a different kind of peace into my life.

smarter_than_an_oreo,2020-03-11,"I used tetris to prohibit the onset of PTSD. My much younger sister and I were sleeping in our car at a trailhead late at night (multi-week road trip). We were parked next to telephone poles that were making that buzzing sound.

Around 1am a car came racing up and crashed heavily into a concrete barrier about 20 feet from our car. We had blinds everywhere so couldn't see anything. I could only hear when the brakes started screeching and I thought we'd be dead, either from the car hitting us or hitting the poles.

I honestly was terrified to get out of the car and see the damage, then I started hearing a girl screaming asking if someone was okay. I got out, the screaming girl was bleeding, I was hesitant to look inside the car but was relieved to see only one other girl, alive and not bleeding much. I called 911 and started helping in ways I could. It was difficult because the second girl was obviously high and hurt internally but wouldn't stop trying to move (you're supposed to stay still in case of spinal injuries)

It was a long night, ambulances, cops, fathers, just...everything. We were able to leave but still had to find a place to sleep (at 3am) and every car we heard, every tiny screech of a tire was just mortifying.

I literally forced my sister and I to download Tetris and start playing. What I had learned is they gave it to vets immediately after combat, whether that part is true I don't know, but I swear it helped and by the end of the trip we were fine. I have already had a near death experience and I'm still not okay after 7 years, but this event I'm completely fine without any therapy.

I found out about them in 2022 or so, and after a bit, I wanted to involve myself in projects that people were making, so I started auditioning for all sorts of shows. I've even auditioned for AnimationEpic (creators behind Inanimate Insanity) even when I didn't have the proper gear nor experience.

Most shows I've worked on never hit the public due to hiatus or canceling production (happens a LOT)--but I've gotten a few that are now out on YouTube and I've been so proud of my work since then.

A couple of ways:

1. r/tipofmyjoystick is quite helpful for this and is already here on Reddit.
2. If you're cool seeking help on Discord, MobyGames has a channel specifically for helping find a game you can't quite remember. A few others are helpful in this regard as well:

SandboxUniverse,2015-09-08,"My first thought is you can go broad or you can go deep.  Broad means you try a bunch of things.  It's great because you can learn techniques and concepts you can apply across your other hobbies.  Deep means you pursue things to gain expertise in particular things.   You can paint,  but can you paint a variety of styles? Use multiple mediums?  Have you studied how your choice of brush, paint, and stroke affects the outcome?  This is also great,  because eventually if you dive deep enough,  you might create a new technique entirely that you won't find otherwise.  

I'm saying all of this because you have a lot of hobbies going already.   I could suggest needlework, ceramics,  and lampwork and call it a day,  but in six months,  you might be looking for more again,   and they kind of add up over time, cost-wise.  So I'm encouraging you to also consider your approach.  If you enjoy collecting hobbies,  well,  that's a hobby too, and a fun one.  It's certainly been one of mine, although not all my outlets are creative.  

 I have taken up astronomy, cross stitch, violin, swim, gardening, raising succulents,  cake decorating,  making terrariums, fostering animals, sailing, model building...  you get the idea.

I've also dug deep  - often literally - into gardening,  learning about the plants in my particular yard and how to deal with them.

BuildingMyEmpireMN,2016-12-18,"Aquascaping! It‚Äôs planting inside aquariums in an aesthetically pleasing way. Great for nitpicky people because so much goes into it. Any fish/plant that lives in water is used to a certain set of ‚Äúparameters‚Äù like temperature, ph level, light intensity, duration of light, substrate, etc. There are also very involved setup and maintenance steps. 

You have to get an aquarium ‚Äúestablished‚Äù aka get the natural ecosystem going where there are enough bacteria that eat the fish waste to sustain the population. 

Then there‚Äôs maintenance. Feeding, cleaning, trimming plants, testing water, etc. 

A lot of people just see the beautiful display. But soooo much goes into establishing it and maintaining it. You truly have to have a gifted eye to anticipate what will look good and thrive because everything is alive and has needs.",0.31887755102040816,Positivo

_higglety,2018-12-17,"If you get into fiber arts, you can go down some DEEP rabbit holes. Most people are familiar with sewing, embroidery, knitting, and crochet, at least in concept, but you can branch pretty far out into some extremely niche, lesser-known specialized art forms. If you crochet, you can make garments and blankets, but you can also make soft sculpture, micro-crochet, and lace. Embroidery can be cross-stitch, chinese double-sided, Elizabethian blackwork, spanish goldwork, etc. Sewing can be quilting, cosplay, historical costuming, etc. You can weave on a vast array of looms, from the simplest back-strap loom to vertical wall looms to full-sized floor looms, and many other sizes and configurations besides. There's inkle weaving, card weaving, and finger-weaving (which is similar in structure but distinct in application from sprang). There's lots of different styles of braiding, such as finger-loop braids and kumihimo. There's knotwork such as macrame and nalbinding, and so many different kinds of lacework that i couldn't possibly list them all. If you want to get REALLY weird and niche, you could take up victorian hairwork. And every culture throughout history and around the world has their own traditions and artforms that you can explore, from the various textile manipulation techniques of japanese kimono, to the incredibly intricate and detailed mola made by the Guna. And of course beyond all that, you could explore processing and spinning fiber into the thread, string, yarn and cordage needed to do all of these!  

(not to mention, many of these crafts can branch off into other things- processing cordage can lead to basket weaving, spinning and sewing can lead to various forms of dyeing, which can lead to foraging, gardening, and chemistry, some fibercrafts require tools which aren't readily available in modern times so you may take up woodworking, smithing, carving, ceramics, or scrimshaw, etc etc ad infinitum)",0.11912698412698412,Positivo

Instead of dice you use a normal deck of playing cards, shuffle them and draw them for each Exploration and Combat phase. You‚Äôll get 5 prompts to write about, you can either fight an enemy or run. 

In theory all you need to play is the rule book, notepad, pen/pencil, a deck of cards (or a virtual deck of cards).

BlakeMW,2016-04-24,"And here's something cool: meditation retreats can be expensive, but Buddhist monasteries often allow the same thing for free. 

Many monasteries will have a weekly or so ""dhamma talk"" at the monastery or sometimes an associated location, usually with a guided meditation. 

Also at many monasteries it's possible to stay for free as long as you're willing to follow the schedule and are well behaved (these monasteries get an excessive amount of donations from asian Buddhists wanting to ""make merit"", it's genuinely fine to stay without donating anything if you're sincere).

This is not true of all traditions: Mahayana and Tibetan tend to charge money. Theravada tends not to. But in the west as an English speaker, best to look up ""Thai Forest Tradition"", it is popular with westerners and has monasteries in most countries, and as forest monasteries they are usually at beautiful peaceful locations.

Source: spent about 8 years of my life living in Buddhist monasteries in New Zealand, Australia and Thailand. For about 5 years as an ordained monk. It was great. And the only money I ever needed to spend was travel.

And the guests at these monasteries were all sorts, along with the expected serious meditators and devoted buddhists, we'd also get backpackers and people who just wandered in and knew literally nothing about Buddhism.",0.20338203463203466,Positivo

If you get into it though, that's when the trouble starts. You might start eyeing more crochet hooks, stitch markers, tapestry scissors (at least these are one-time purchases usually). Then there's the yarn. Buying more yarn can be addictive. I accrued a lot of yarn in the early days as I just got so excited about it, but thankfully I did reach a point where I was like: ""Yeah, I definitely do not need more yarn. I'm good now.""

Crochet, being the gateway drug, also led me to knitting. Which is great, since now I have two ways to use up my sizeable yarn stash. But I also spent a small fortune on knitting needles. Straight needles, circular needles, double pointed needles in different materials, sizes and lengths.

2. Recognize when your mind drifts to something else. Acknowledge it. Process it. Go back to breathing. In. Out. In. Out. 

3. Once you're solidly only thinking about breathing, try to toss that thought away too. THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT. If you successfully aren't thinking about your breaths anymore, you should have a blank mind. This is the main goal. 

4. While working towards the goal of thinking about literally nothing, continue to acknowledge any thoughts that arrive. See them. Toss them away.

Kevin_Uxbridge,2015-08-01,"Archaeologist here.  I'd strongly encourage you to do this ethically, find something, take a picture with your phone, put it back.  You get to 'keep it' forever and leave it for someone else to find, it's a win-win.

That said, you'd do well to look for places with water.  If there's water now, there was likely water in the past.  These are the places were people have hung out for millennia.  Creek beds are good, shorelines, that kinda thing.  Farmed fields are also prime, especially after rainstorms.  Areas disturbed by building work, roads and whatnot.  

Keep your eyes peeled and look for things that look like they've been chipped.  If you think you've found something, compare your pictures with stuff online, there's tons of pictures at r/arrowheads that'll help you learn to tell an artifact from a JAR ('just a rock')

LoL_is_pepega_BIA,2019-11-13,"Adding to this, a lot of people struggle with meditation by putting in a lot of effort and stress to make their mind blank.. this is akin to a sisyphean effort. 

The whole point here is to let go of trying, let go of the effort.. you don't need to try to breathe, it just happens.. you don't need to push your mind to relax, it will happen on its own, eventually as you begin to develop better awareness of your inner thought flow and patterns, and make peace with it..

Think of your thoughts as a continuously flowing river. You can't really stop it or redirect it or even control it, so simply let it flow, let it pass.. 

One tool that's helped me is to think of the mind as a child that's trying to leave the play pen. Be kind to it and help it back inside when it leaves..

Another perspective that's really helped me is as follows.. there are 3 core tenets to meditation. For the duration of meditation, 1. you do absolutely nothing, 2. You want absolutely nothing, and 3. Most importantly, you ARE nothing (any insecurity in terms of looks or wealth, or perhaps superiority complex are things you need to let go of and ground yourself)

Also, social media and mobile apps with dark engagement patterns are  extremely anti-meditation. Please be responsible with them like any other toxic substance. Zero is best.

The hardware is expensive, especially if you want the highest settings and decent performance.

I like to get 10 cents an hour out of my software purchases, but I realize that's only possible with averages. I average shorter enjoyed experiences like e.g. Firewatch with a Bethesda Games Studios product that I spend so many thousands of hours in that the fact that the former laughs at my ten cents an hour entertainment budget not really matter.

Plus, as much as I ""enjoy"" mindlessly plugging at a BGS product on the off chance I'll see something new and interesting I'd be lying if I didn't admit that experiences like Tacoma and Firewatch are why I play games, even if Bethesda Games Studios somehow makes desecrating the dead for fun and profit feel nearly heroic.

Extraterrestrialchip,2017-11-12,"Making patchwork quilts. Although I have found a cheaper supplier for the fabric etc, it's still not cheap for good quality cotton fabric. They usually require many different fabrics. Some are bought by length but some are precut into strips or squares which is way more convenient but kicks the cost up. 

Once the top's made you need wadding for the middle which again is costly, and then you need backing fabric which either has to be wider than standard fabric or you have to buy yards of it to piece together to cover the back.

Then the actual quilting to sew it all together; extremely difficult for a full size quilt on a standard sewing machine. You can struggle yourself (which I have) or you can have it done on a quilting machine but that's wildly expensive. Out of interest I've had quotes, they charge by the square inch and it adds ¬£100 upwards often more for a bigger quilt.

This hobby has been fun, frustrating, downright rage inducing, and incredibly rewarding all at once.

Living in the middle of nowhere, on a dirt road, it probably sounds crazy to put on a light show for just myself and two neighbors, and that's how I felt the first season, but I found out it wasn't just for me and 2 neighbors. 

We're now quite known in the area! It has brought our small farming community together, and we get so many visitors during the holidays. It makes me proud to show off all my hardwork.

One example was my wife had passed away, and her former assistant became my assistant for a while. She's a great assistant, but can't get her own life together because of health reasons. At the time, her family was a piece of shit, and had a tendency to just use her as that ""unmarried aunt"" role where they'd go on these elaborate vacations and assumed she's take care of their house while they were gone. Her older brother was the worst of them. he had bought some huge McMansion somewhere for his wife and four kids. One day, he said he was going to Disneyworld and taking the whole family. That did not include his sister, but other relatives, like some cousins and their mother.

My assistant was heartbroken. Like, it crushed her. While she's not one of those over-the-top Disney fans you see on Instagram, she did like Disney a whole lot since she was a little girl.  I was an event runner, and an opportunity came up to meet with another event runner I knew who lived in Orlando and wanted to hang out for a bit. I could have easily gone by myself, but I figured if I paid for it, I could bring her. Only one caveat: she had to plan it. Airfare, hotel, the parks, everything. My event would NOT foot that bill, but I could afford to. And buddy, she did a great job.  She got us cheap tickets, cheap rooms in Disney Springs, and discounted pretty much everything. We didn't have to pay for Disney World itself, since the party we were meeting had out passes for that. But we did have to pay for Universal. 

We had a great time. While we did separate things, we spent most of the time together and I got to see Disney World through a fan's eyes. Normally, I would have just wandered aimlessly, but she had a PLAN and without her, it would have just been another trip for me. And this gave her the opportunity to finally see Disney World, something she could have never done on her own or have anyone do for her.

I am still glad I could do that for someone, and if I had more money, I'd be doing that a lot more.",0.19963235294117648,Positivo

Various species of wood are expensive for natural beauty.

The tools for cutting and dimensioning are expensive even second hand, but the Rabbit Hole also includes Dust Collection, Clamps, back up blades, Bright Lights, bunch of Bandaids and super glue, and possibly a shed.  (Oh, and there will be an ER visit).  Woodworking also comes with the added psychological benefit of hoarding things for years in hopes of incorporating it into a project, and viewing everyday items in new ways; Chopsticks from takeout can be used as dowel rods and coffee stirrers make great shims, glue applicators and oil mixers.

It‚Äôs creative and you do get something to show for it, BUT, it is hard, dirty work that takes 6 times as long as you think - endless mistakes and profanity that keep changing the original design.  Followed by obsessive amount of sanding only to arrive at ‚ÄúFinishing‚Äù, which really pisses me off when it points out any imperfection which sends you back to sanding.

Once the piece is finished and placed in a room, after we have toiled intimately with this project for weeks or months, we will feel the sting of the remaining mistakes each time we walk in the room.

While it can be done cheaply, you really have to love the process to do it without forking over serious cash. Absent formal training by a master, most of the modern YouTubers are using the very best equipment available which makes replicating work difficult or at least frustrating. It‚Äôs also highly commercial. I think people outside the space imagine Ron Swanson and grizzled old-timers hunched over an old workbench with a chisel when it‚Äôs really $800+ track saws, jointer/planers that can easily approach $10k, and workbench accessories that can be hundreds of dollars a piece. The audience is mostly mid-thirties to forties males approaching their maximal earning years, so the sky is the limit and the marketing audience is still small enough where influencers aren‚Äôt making massive cash piles on views and advertising, so it‚Äôs easy to put free stuff in their hands and drive purchasing.

[eliminado],,"I'll share my hobby again because I feel that it is my one unique contribution to reddit.  I distill alcohol.  Whiskey, moonshine, or whatever you want to call it. I started doing beer and wine years ago and slowly gathered the equipment and knowledge I needed to learn to distill properly.  

Any fool can make rotgut, but I wanted something better than I could buy in stores.  I have completed one batch of double distilled grain alcohol.  It came out at about 94% abv.  It mixed well with anything, tasted completely clean, and gave a much more lucid high than store bought alcohol.  I attribute this to my pride in my own product, but also the fact that I can make it more pure than any company who has to protect profit margins.  Other friends that tried it had the same experience.  

I made several fresh fruit macerations with it: strawberry, blackberry, and blueberry.  Those were sweet and syrupy and came out to around 60 proof (30% ABV).  These are easily made and I found them on an internet under a recipe called ""panty-dropper.""  These are the most universally appealing product I have made among all my beer, wine, and liquor endeavors.

I made some ""Apple Pie Shine"" that I had heard about.  Recipes typically call for various measures of apple juice, sugar, alcohol, and apple pie spices.  My final recipe had a can of apple juice concentrate, no added sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cardamom...I think that's all.  It was sweet and had a subtle cinnamon burn at the end.  Mine was about 50 proof.  This was also pretty popular amongst the masses.  I would make a gallon of this stuff and it'd be gone before I could blink.

The last thing I made was a lemoncello.  Recipe is alcohol, lemon zest, sugar, and a few weeks of maceration time.  I cut it to 100 proof.  It was strong, sweet, and had all kinds of good lemon flavor.  

But those are just making sweet liqueurs and cordials from alcohol I distilled.  So far it is all I have had the time and ambition to do. The real art of distillation comes in the flavored spirits, which are more involved.  I also want to get into oak aging and smoking grains since I love  scotch.  Making a good corn whiskey is also something I'd like to do.  My ultimate goal is to make something like a Laphroaig 10 year from the ground up (malt my own barley, maybe even grow it myself, etc).  But that is quite involved and something I'm saving for retirement or at least a time in my life when I can devote more time to the hobby.

That's what I do for fun, and I'm hoping I can do it more often now that I am done with school and work for awhile.  The only drawback is that this is an illegal hobby.  While it isn't very heavily enforced, I do find articles occasionally of backwoods moonshiners getting busted.  Popcorn Sutton was a interesting and sad tale if you wanna google that one.  I have yet to find a moonshine bust on a hobby-scaled operation like mine, but I keep it mostly to myself anyways just to be safe.",0.21245421245421242,Positivo
anshu1234,2008-04-27,"Okay, so i browsed fast for the comments and this isn't mentioned.   


So i see you need a hobby but cheap and you didn't mention you have group of friends to start this hobby etc.  
 

I suggest you start having a fishtank, it is one of the most entertaining, educational and artistic hobby out there, you can start it from dirt-cheap with 40-50 bucks then if this hobby catches you , you might even spend 100 or 300 bucks every 2-3 months to get it perfect.    



Some of the inspirations I got was from [Takashi amano tanks](http://www.google.com/images?oe=UTF-8&gfns=1&q=takashi+amano+gallery&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=B5IITM-_Hc6wrAenrb2nAQ&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CDcQsAQwAw) this guy is pro who spends thousand dollars on one tank and has international shop on his name, so its not possible to get beautiful on day one but you can start small.   


I am moderator at [/r/fishtank](http://reddit.com/r/fishtank) and I have posted many starter guides and then videos of small tanks, other redditors too post there, you are welcome to join there and ask questions.   



This hobby is entertaining because the fish interact with you and each one is a character. The interaction with fish is priceless (specially if you raise them from batch of eggs like i did, its painful process in caring them but worth it and I earned big by selling off excess fish).    


This hobby is Artistic because, if you are artsy type, you have endless option to make your tank mimic a spot of a biotope, it can be black,rocky bottom section from a african lake, it can be murky and grassy biotope from florida lakes or it can be a crystal clear grassy/mossy mountain biotope imagined by yourself (like a real scene of forest but under water).     



This can be highly educational experience, because you start playing god, trying to mimic a eco-system in a small glass tank, the parameters you juggle with are small but strict and it takes time for you to balance it out , this learning experience is extremely humbling, you start looking different at mother nature and when you come across a ditch of pond or small running lake you can look below surface and appreciate the chemical and biological balance which is going there. You will come across tons of fun facts when really going for planted fishtank, you will learn whats the normal PH for tap-water, how PH increase or decrease make the same water alkaline or acidic, how the contents in our stomach are curdled due to acidic elements which have PH 2 (extremely acidic) etc etc. the fun as a geek here is endless. you play with water-testing kit and test tube and record stuff etc etc.



So there, try to read on making a fishtank, just get a glass tank first, establish it with nitrogen cycle (going with planted tank takes just a week for cycling) and then your options are endless.",0.1685769656699889,Positivo

StrangeMD,2010-02-20,"Falconry, if you really have some free time. Obviously it's not for everyone. In fact if you've never thought about it before on your own, you probably won't suddenly decide to pick it up. Since I started young, I've been able to commit time to it without shirking any major responsibilities that 'adults' with careers and families might have, but there's also tons of adults that are able to balance the two without neglecting either. I started with a kestrel, and over four years I've also trained and kept a red-tailed hawk and a harris hawk.

For starters, it's not easy, but stress and hardship make every single step incredibly rewarding. You acquire a ton of skills/knowledge in the process (leather crafting, shelter building, life history, medical knowledge etc). As far as money goes, if you take the time to learn to make your own jesses/hood and shelter then the only real cost is food (~$5 a day) and ~$100-200 dollars in permits.

The feeling I get when I'm out in an open field and seeing my bird of prey do what it was so perfectly designed for is indescribable. The fact that it has every ability in the world to leave and never come back, yet CHOOSES to return to me on its own free will just adds to the wonderment. 

Excerpt from the California Hawking Apprenticeship Manual:
*""The reward that comes from practicing falconry is, and has to be, a feeling of your own personal satisfaction; that, and that alone. Chances are no one else will be around when your hawk is at her best. Falconry is a tedious, time consuming effort with long periods of stress and anxiety punctuated by heartbeats of gut-wrenching visceral satisfaction so intense that is impossible to put into words.""*",0.20888752052545156,Positivo

I've kept aquariums, breeding various species (including [shelldwellers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_dwellers) which were probably my favorite). That was a very involved hobby, but you have to care about it. I ended up having around 7 aquariums, ranging from 5 gallons to 55. Used equipment's fairly cheap, but the fish can get pricey and hard to find. 

I recently built a welder out of microwave oven transformers, and semi-taught myself to weld (something I've always wanted to do). It was pretty easy to do, see pictures [here](http://imgur.com/0rpyO.jpg) and [here](http://imgur.com/TOGpc.jpg). This was awesome, and pretty cheap. Find a few broken microwaves, get some heavy wire, and alligator clips.

When I have time, I cook. I enjoy making my own bread, spaetzle, pierogi, burgers, whatever. Cheap, and very enjoyable.

*side note*
Having a girlfriend is the biggest drain of time I've ever experienced.

When I was in high school, I did some pretty cool stuff. [Here's](http://imgur.com/1o00T.jpg) a picture of me with my flamethrower, and [here's](http://imgur.com/IfgMF.png) a screencap of a video I recorded of some experiments in chemistry.

I think building and modifying things is my favorite. My laptop and a handprint worn out on it from playing too much CounterStrike, so I took it apart and repainted it with vinyl dye. It doesn't look to bad, and I didn't even try that hard. 

I've always liked shooting, so I dropped $200 on a 22 and $70 on a scope, and spent some time at the range. [Here's](http://imgur.com/L8XUr.jpg) a picture of my baby. The stock was too short, and I didn't have the $90 I wanted to spend on the nice folding [one](http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/RGR013-1.html) I want, so I made it a little longer. I was really drunk and half-assing it, but it works. And it's adjustable. Also, I modified the internals by adding set screws to the sear and hammer, because the trigger pull was too hard and there was some wiggle. I knew nothing about guns going into this, and spent a lot of time researching.

I also have a guitar I used to screw around on. I think music is beautiful, and I envy those who make it. However, I do not have the time or patience to pursue it myself, I have decided. Maybe I'll try again over the next two years.

I feel like I'm missing a few big ones. Maybe I'll edit this later.

Edit - took me about 30 seconds of looking at some other posts to realize I'd missed two big ones:

Photography. Ever since I stole my parent's old Minolta SLR, I've had a fascination with beautifully capturing moments of my life. There's something saddening about losing memories, and I think photography is my way of preserving it. This one is really important to me. I look back on my life, and regret not having more pictures to look at. I've forgotten so many stories, so many stupid things I've done... I finally mustered up $700 to buy a really nice dSLR with two lenses, and have been learning about the principles in photography. But if it's not your thing, I can't convince you to try it.

Brewing. I really like(d) beer. But I wasn't 21, so no one would sell it to me. However, they would sell me the ingredients needed to make it. So I did. It doesn't take much time, is cheap, and rewarding. Totally worth trying, if you're interested.

Yes, really.

I can recommend cooking, geocaching, and moustache growing for cheapness. Food preserving has a medium sized initial cost but pays dividends in year round delicious foods. There's nothing quite like walking into a pantry full of brightly coloured fruits packed into jars. It impresses dinner guests no end when you produce some and have a tasting for dessert,

The others are probably more expensive to get started but don't cost all that much once you're going. Watchmaking, for instance, requires some tools but they'll literally last you the rest of your life and you can get ""broken"" vintage watches to repair quite cheaply. Beekeeping requires all sorts of odds and ends to get started but not all that much to keep going. You can use the honey to make mead which always goes over well at parties.

Did you draw a lot or play with Legos?* You could buy canvas and acrylics and start painting (and gifting portraits to your friends!), making miniatures, painting figurines and building scenarios for role-playing games (and maybe selling them!), sculpting, painting on your own T-shirts and maybe buy a serigraphy machine later, sewing your own clothes, wood-carving or building your own furniture.

*Do you like reading? Did you use to make up stories when you played?* You could try writing (a short story, a poem, a song, a script, a comic), take up acting classes, or role playing with friends or strangers. Or reading a lot, and maybe reviewing books in a blog.

*Do you like physical activities (or used to be active and then got lazy)?* PLaying a sport or going to the gym is an option.. but how about taking up dancing classes, martial arts, juggling, trekking, biking, swimming, surfing, skating?

This is just an example list, categories can be modified or added and of course, the list of activities is endless, so if you don't like the ones I came up with, try to find some on your own. And please let us know if you make up your mind!",0.1641304347826087,Positivo

ZippyDan,2008-04-02,">Chess. If you like games it is the perfect strategy game.

I used to think this until I discovered Go many years back.  Go is much simpler (in terms of rules and mechanics) and yet is so much deeper and complex (in terms of strategy and thought).  It is the quintessential minutes-to-learn-lifetime-to-master experience.  

The board and pieces and gameplay are beautiful in their simplicity, yet the way of thinking required to succeed will shatter many of your stereotypical conceptions of gaming.  I find that Go also reflects both real warfare and real life much better than Chess.  The Asians recognized this long before I did.  Like life, it can be seen in the abstract as seemingly very orderly.  But from this deceptive order emerges a chaotic experience that only the most flexible and broadest of minds can hope to understand, not to mention control.

When discussing Go vs. Chess, it comes down to a discussion of strategy vs. tactics.  I will grant you that at the higher levels of play, strategy is very important in Chess.  However, fundamentally, Chess is a tactical game.  This is why computers do so well at Chess.  If you can, theoretically, play a tactically perfect game of Chess (that means optimizing each individual move), then strategy is irrelevant.  The worst you will do is draw.

On the other hand, you have Go, which has every bit as much tactical depth as Chess, but which also demands a higher-level abstract strategic outlook that cannot be easily defined by simple logical thinking.  Chess is for left-brained thinkers that can calculate dozens of permutations in a sequential and orderly fashion.  Conversely, you cannot do well at Go without both brain sides.  This is why Go has been rightly said to be a much more artistic game.  Each move must be tactically strong, but must also be valid to the overall strategic outlook.  A good move in Go is as much determined by an intuitive undefinable feeling as it is by logical precision.

You can break down Chess into manageable portions by analyzing each individual piece and all of its possible moves to determine the best move.  In Go, this is impossible.  If you develop tunnel-vision and only try to determine the possibilities for a piece or a group of pieces, you will fail.  You must take a holistic approach.

This is why the very best Go computer AI will be easily defeated by only an average player.  The computer can quickly master the micro-level tactics, but fails utterly at the macro-level strategy.  There is simply no way to optimize each move with any set of reliable tactical algorithms, and the Go board has far too many permutations to allow a complete solution any time soon.  This is also why you will find Go featured in the movies *A Beautiful Mind* and *Pi*.  Both feature extraordinary left-brained geniuses who find it very difficult to understand Go at a strategic level.  As I recall, Crowe's character in *A Beautiful Mind* is frustrated when he loses miserably playing Go despite his protest that he played a ""mathematically perfect"" game.  And that is exactly what I love about Go.  You can play every move tactically perfect and still lose.  And yet, tactics are still crucial, as without tactics, you cannot achieve your strategic goals.  By demanding all your brain power, both intuitive and logical, it is the definition of mind blowing.

One final item of note, is that Chess (and Go) is inherently imbalanced.  White always has an advantage by moving first.  At least in Go, this imbalance is addressed in the rules.  Additionally, first move is much more important in a tactical game than in a strategic one.  Since a tactical game can be distilled to a-series-of-moves, that first move can be key.  Go's nebulous mechanics make the first move much less decisive.

If you think I'm just making this up, check out boardgamegeek.com and see how Chess ranks vs. Go.  :)

Also, there are many places you can play Go online.  The best have online ranking systems so that you are only paired with similarly skilled players, and get to feel a sense of accomplishment as you rank up.  :)  Try http://www.gokgs.com/ for one.",0.13211042840075096,Positivo

There already is one out there (MegaSquirt), but it's based on an ancient chip (HC08), uses old technologies (COM ports, etc), and extensions to it mostly have to be written in 68K asm. I'd love to make a nice modern Cortex M3 one, with a virtual COM port onboard, all python interface software for configuration and fuel mapping, etc. If I get good enough, CANbus spy/tamper and bluetooth, too.",0.24649122807017546,Positivo

mr_mlk,2011-12-14,"A few years ago I did a quarterly challenge, trying four new hobbies a year. During that I tried:

* Lock picking. Cheap, easy to get started with. I didn't keep it up, but it is interesting to do.
* Drones. I really like the idea of drone flying. It has never really clicked for me. No idea why. Quite a high starting cost.
* 3D Modeling/printing. Unless you like tinkering, get a decent printer (A1 mini as a ""cheap"" example), and it is great fun. Still do it, but inconsistently.
* Air gun shooting - absolutely amazing fun. Definitely recommend if you 10+m you can shoot in. Snowpeak CP2 (Diana Chaser) is a decent starter at ¬£160. It was my primary hobby for a few years until...
* Clay Pigeon (trap). This is now my primary hobby. With VR, I'm getting at least a round of trap in 5 days a week. It is not cheap, but not horrendously expensive. 
* Practical Shotgun. The only reason this is not my primary hobby is my local range is only open 2 days a month. Really good fun, but expensive.

Outside of this attempt to find new things to do, I also:

* Board games. Before kids I went on regular trips to board game clubs. 
* Video games. Bit of a rarity for me these days.
* Programming, especially on ""odd"" hardware.",0.10719082719082722,Positivo

- Biking: Mountain biking, Gravel biking, road biking, bike packing, bike building and trail building. Also, I lump fitness with biking in as well, which is running, lifting and yoga.

- Photography: digital and film, film developing, image manipulation, etc. I also lump general art together other photography, and occasionally I deep dive into drawing and watercolor.

Those are my main three, but I do some gaming with the kids, and a lot of outdoor stuff with them‚Ä¶ which is usually camping that leads to fishing.

It‚Äôs legit not as expensive or as hard as you may think. My biggest rec is to identify the music you enjoy the most or would enjoy emulating, then do some research and ask on the forum related to the instrument. Don‚Äôt just settle for the crappy bundles your local guitar center will set you up with. For most music needs, you can do it with a guitar or piano and maybe even voice if you want. But there‚Äôs also a plethora of other instruments and music to choose from. One of my favs is the banjo and the synthesizer which is its own world outside of the piano.

Kaydrake,2016-09-10,"I raise butterflies. Mostly Monarch Butterflies but also Eastern Black Swallowtails and some others that occasionally show up in my garden. The occasional moth too. 

I bring in eggs or any caterpillar I can provide food and a safe place for until they are fully grown.  I release them when they become an adult. If they end up sick or diseased, instead of releasing them, I care for them until they pass away.

When I find them sick or in need of help out in the world I bring them in and help them recover. If they don't get better, they have a calm place with me until they pass.

It is both a heartbreaking and joyous hobby to have. When I'm out in the garden they will land on me and let me hold them. When they are sick they come to me and let me care for them. Even ones I have not raised. I've learned so much from them and feel blessed to have the trust of such beautiful creatures.

Started because I wanted to take cool pictures of stuff in space.

It's a great hobby but it's tough since the equipment can be pricey and you have to do it at night. Also, my favorite objects are in the winter so I usually end up doing super cold nights out in the high desert for best viewing.

I like to help cam models with career development. I help with the SEO writing of profiles, tutor them in English, and get them custom graphics for profiles, and help them with other things that pop up while working as cam models.

When I lived abroad, I befriended a bunch of girls working in the sex tourism industry. They would show me around the city and buy me all sorts of food. In return, I started tutoring them in English. Once I moved back to The States, I got a TEFL certification and wanted to teach English abroad. But that didn't work out.

Fast-forward a few years, some of my friends started getting involved with cam modeling. One of the new girls came from a poorer village and didn't know much English, so I agreed to tutor her as a favor to my friend. Word of mouth spread, and more models reached out. I kept doing it because I enjoyed it. After a few changes in the industry and getting to know what the models wanted help with, I started helping out with things like SEO writing, pricing, and other random business-related things that are difficult without a strong grasp of English or a bank account in the US.

MasteringTheFlames,2015-07-20,"Bicycle touring! Every once in a while I like to load some camping gear onto the back of my bicycle and disappear for a few days.

It started when I was 13 years old. I was surfing though /r/IAmA and I came upon an AMA by a guy who had cycled from northern Alaska to the southern tip of south America. I enjoy cycling, I love camping, and I'd recently returned from my first international travels, which I very much enjoyed, so I was very interested. After reading his AMA, I discovered /r/bicycletouring and crazyguyonabike.com, where I spent a ton of time reading about other people's travels, and how I could follow in their footsteps (or tire tracks?) one day.

Finally, the summer when I was 16, I felt confident enough about it to pitch the idea to my father. Not the idea of cycling around the world, but just starting small, riding 40 miles to a state park we'd driven to many times before, spending the night in a campground, and then cycling home the next day. The first try went terribly, but I have it another shot a week later, which went off without a hitch. And I loved it. So the best summer, I stepped up my game to a four day, 200 mile trip.

The year after that, I was 18 years old. At this point I'd decided to take a gap year (or two... On pace for three) between high school and college to spend a year or so biking across the country. So after spending one last summer screwing around with my friends from high school before they scattered across the country for college, I did my biggest trip to date. In mid-September,I left my home in South-central Wisconsin on a three week, almost 1300 mine journey clockwise around Lake Michigan. It was an incredible experience, honestly a highlight of my life so far, and it really convinced me that this was what I wanted to do.

After that, I got a job, just a basic retail job, and worked full-time, saving up for that big cross-country trip. I worked that job from December of 2017 until just this past June. Along the way I used some paid vacation time in October of 2018 and flew my bike out to Asheville, NC to spend two weeks cycling up the Blue Ridge Parkway and then over to Washington DC.

My last day at my job was July 1. I've spent the past couple weeks buying a few new pieces of gear, and taking classes on bike maintainence and first aid. In another week or two, I think I'll finally be ready to go. I'm about to realize a dream I've had for almost half my life, at this point. I'm a bit terrified, but definitely more excited than scared now!

**EDIT** I just realized I got so distracted with the story of *how* I got into it that I forgot about *why* I do it. When I was about 12 years old, I started using cycling as a coping mechanism, to get out of the house when my parents were fighting (which ultimately led to their divorce, 5 years later). And I've loved camping my whole life. Some of my earliest memories are of the camping trips my family would go on in the summer. So when I discovered that other people had combined the two, of course I had to give it a try!

Why did I stick with it? A lot of people look at me like I'm crazy when I tell them about this, especially considering most of my trips have started and ended in my driveway in Wisconsin. Like, who wants to watch the endless corn fields roll by at 12 miles an hour, day after day? But moving that slowly gives you time to find the beauty in the mundane. The way the cornstalks sway in the breeze on one side of the road, the birds chirping in the forest in the other side. I can't count the number of times I've stopped to watch some wildlife --lots of deer, a few raccoons, an owl once!-- and as I was standing off the side of the road, drivers would pass me, they might slow down a bit and look at me, like ""what's the crazy bike dude looking at??"" but they inevitably drive off before noticing the wildlife.

And the other really big reason I love it is all the wonderful people I meet. My first exposure to this was on that second trip I mentioned. I camped in state parks all three nights. The third morning, I woke up and ate a basic breakfast of a bagel with peanut butter and some dried fruit. As I was taking the tent down and loading up the bike, a guy from the campsite across the road came over to chat. He said he saw the bike, and the lack of a car, and started asking about what I was up to. I told him all about my trip, and he eventually invited me to join him and his family for breakfast. I noticed they were coming bacon and pancakes, and I'm vegan, so I politely decided his offer, saying I had a long day ahead of me and wanted to get an early start. In hindsight, I should've joined them just for the company, even if they didn't have anything I'd eat.  
Then on the Lake Michigan trip, I met tons of awesome people as well. They'd see me sitting at picnic tables in town parks, and come to ask about the bike. A lot of them would offer to top off my water bottles, or give me food, or just chat for a while, which was always appreciated by this solo traveler.

On the Blue Ridge Parkway trip, I decided to do something fun to forever remind myself of these people. On my way out of Asheville the first day, I had to stop at a Walgreens for bug spray, and while I was in there I grabbed a couple of silver sharpies. Anyone I met along the way, whether they just asked about my trip for a few minutes, or they gave me a ride to a restaurant where I could wait out a miserable rain storm, was invited to sign the frame of my bike. I thought this would be the birth of a long tradition, but after just two weeks, my bike was already completely covered in names, along with comments of ""good luck!"" and ""safe travels"" and even an ""I love you bro!"" It's really inspiring, not only later during that trip when I was counting big mountains, but even just commuting home after a rough day at work, to look down and see all those well-wishes there.

Sometimes I hate bike touring. It's not always sunshine and butterflies. Some days truly suck. But even those days are kind of fun in their own twisted ways. To paraphrase someone much wiser than me, ""you'll never tell the story of the time you reserved a campsite and then checked into it without issue."" Instead, the bike touring story I tell most often is the time I almost got hypothermia while climbing a mountain, and ended up hitchhiking to a restaurant where I could wait out the rain with some warm food. But those days still add to the experience, and they make the really, really great days all the more better, knowing the shit I pushed through to get there.

When you travel by bicycle, your truly experience the world in a way you otherwise can't. Every single hill you climb, every mile marker you pass, every headwind that finally fades away, are achievements of their own. Traveling by your own power is, in my opinion, the best way to make it about the journey instead of the destination. And so I guess that's why I love bicycle touring.

**TL;DR** Every once in a while I load some camping gear onto the back of my bicycle and disappear for a few days or weeks. Why do I do it? It forces me to slow down and truly appreciate the everyday beauty of our world, and I meet tons of awesome people in the process!",0.12371446755593099,Positivo

EDIT 2: For anyone who wants to start painting rocks (which is super relaxing, and hiding them is really fun plus it gets you out of the house) please keep a few things in mind:

* Please use weatherproof sealant or self sealing paint so that rain doesn't ruin them and the paint doesn't end up on plants/animals

* Please be considerate of children when hiding your rocks. If a child would be likely to climb on something that they could fall off of to reach the rock, or would have to step into a garden bed and possibly crush the plants, then please consider placing it somewhere that won't risk them getting hurt or hurting the park gardens

Airsoft in general gets me out of the house and outside once a week. Good for some exercise, good for sportsmanship and teamwork, good to flex the creative muscles for problem solving. I've made awesome friends, traveled to places I'd have never seen before (Nuclear power plant, steel and paper mills, military training grounds, abandoned coal cities), and seen and done things I never would get to experience sitting at home (helicopters, repelling, 1000+ people games). 

I went into sniping specifically because the usual ""run and gun"" became a bit stagnant. Playing as a sniper makes it an entirely different game, with a huge emphasis on stealth (which doesn't necessarily mean wearing a ghillie suit) and communication relay. 

Plus when you pull off a really difficult shot it can be super rewarding. There are some days where I'll have a terrible time, but there's that one shot I managed to land that made the whole weekend worth it.

I ended up being seriously prolific at a pirate themed roleplay group. I had something like 100 characters and wrote for all of them multiple times per day.

I've uploaded 29 and written/drawn 40. I have a huge expansive story relatively well planned out and I plan to do as many comics as it takes to get to the end of it.

It was literally the best thing i ever got involved with. Granted i got paid to do it, but i honestly would have done it for free. Getting paid 10 bucks an hour to go out into the woods, get stoned, and look for rocks was the highlight of my early 20s. There's just something about working stone you found and carried out of the woods yourself that makes you feel so accomplished, I honestly can't explain the feeling, but i think you know what i mean. Sometimes we'd get a big MF on the wall, stand back and just whisper ""fuck that's a nice fit."" We found literally every stone in a 7 foot high, 40 foot long wall (which is why it took us 3 years, we also spent a good hour or so each day getting paid to blaze up which was rad, but also cut down productivity). I'm rambling at this point, but I just wanted to say that I love what you do as a hobby and I hope you keep it up. But as a protip, i really do reccomend a good wheelbarrow especially for long hikes back through the woods. After 2 years of carrying everything by hand we finally got a wheel barrow because we were getting in over a mile deep in the woods and carrying that weight that far will decimate your back fast af (though i will also say i gained incredibly defined arms from it).

As a side note. Do you do any stone cutting for your walls? We had several that were useable with beautiful face but we had to cut a flat surface into cause they were lumpy as hell.

tablair,2017-01-31,"There‚Äôs a number of different training techniques. I do breathing exercises each morning before I get up and at night before I go to sleep. I do lung/rib cage stretching exercises to be able to take bigger breaths. I do relaxation exercises to be able to calm my mind and use less oxygen in my muscles. And there‚Äôs occasional pool work whenever I can find a qualified training partner. That‚Äôs the bulk of it outside of actually going into the ocean and doing it.

My morning exercise is a 4-2-1 that I‚Äôve raised from a 6-second interval, when I first started, to my current 20-second interval. That means I inhale for 20 seconds, hold for 80 seconds and then exhale for 40 seconds. I then repeat that for 30-45 min depending on how I‚Äôm feeling. A single cycle isn‚Äôt particularly difficult, but over the course of the whole exercise, CO2 builds up because a single exhalation isn‚Äôt enough to vent all that my body is producing. After 10-15 min, I start getting contractions in my diaphragm and start to experience the feeling that most people associate with needing to breathe, even though I‚Äôve got plenty of oxygen in my bloodstream. It‚Äôs important in freediving to feel comfortable with that feeling and not have it produce anxiety because it starts to be noticeable around 1/3 of the way though a maximum breath hold. Even untrained people can hold their breath for about twice as long as they think they can if they‚Äôre able to push past the discomfort of the CO2 panic.

The nightly exercise is similar, but it adds an empty lung hold phase to each cycle and shortens the full hold phase. So the timing is 1-1-2-1 and I currently use 15-second increments for that (inhale for 15 seconds, hold for 15 seconds, exhale for 30 seconds, hold for 15 seconds, then repeat). This exercise doesn‚Äôt feel like as much of a struggle as the morning routine, but it helps relax me before bed.

The stretching is all about understanding 3-zone breathing. So each stretch is designed to make that specific zone of my lungs larger and then I take a full breath but only concentrating on that one zone.

The pool sessions usually are about practicing the techniques so I don‚Äôt develop bad habits and learning to lean into the Mammalian Dive Reflex effect. Basically, when cold water is splashed on our faces, it has a calming effect that lowers heart rate and blood pressure. It‚Äôs much more pronounced in babies and gets weaker as we get older, but you can learn to notice and accentuate it, which can mean dropping your heart rate significantly and using less air while underwater. If you‚Äôre interested, there‚Äôs an [excellent TED talk](https://youtu.be/Rai3pwH3XrU) (it‚Äôs in French, but there‚Äôs captions available) by a champion freediver about some of the physiological changes experienced by divers as the go deep underwater.

That‚Äôs most of it. I‚Äôve also developed the habit of holding my breath from time to time just arbitrarily. If I‚Äôm at my desk and I‚Äôm feeling stressed, I‚Äôll just stop breathing for 3-4 minutes to utilize the fact that I now automatically relax and get calm during a breath hold. And since I‚Äôm super sensitive to smoke due to frequently focusing on the feeling in my lungs, I‚Äôll preemptively start holding my breath whenever I see someone smoking on the street and won‚Äôt start breathing again until I‚Äôm out of range if the smoke. I imagine these kind of ad-hoc exercises help too.

Halocarbons are persistent groundwater pollutants but are also generally expensive and are usually recycled. If I do need to dispose of them for whatever reason, small amounts are simply evaporated.

Clean rinsewater as well as innocuous salts like carbonates, chlorides, and sulfates of sodium, potassium, calcium, etc are sent right to my septic tank.

To be honest, the most exhausting thing in the beginning is gathering information and finding out what is the right thing to do in certain situations. It gets much easier and quicker after a few years.

I also know some beekeepers who involve their kids from age 5 or so. It's a great opportunity zo teach them about respecting animals and to show them where their food comes from.

I've learnt that animal abuse is really difficult for me to stomach, unfortunately, in some cases, animals are actually injured or killed for shock value in some films, or the animals later die off-camera (e.g Cannibal Holocaust, Pink Flamingos). It can make it a little hard to watch the film, knowing that it's not all just for show. 

The only hard limit I have is movie scenes involving child characters being sexually abused. I can't watch that. SPOILER AHEAD, SORT OF: Had to skip two scenes in A Serbian Film due to that. But I watched the rest of it no problem.

tablair,2017-01-31,"I would say that dry training is safe to do without instruction, but I'd consult a doctor to make sure there's nothing about your current health where stress on the cardio-pulmonary systems could cause problems. For instance, anyone at high risk for a heart attack or stroke should probably not do these alone, at least to start.

Wet training needs instruction and always needs someone trained in freediving resuscitation, even once you've had instruction. The reason for this is that there's always a risk of passing out. About two months into my training, I did one hold that I held for too long and passed out. But since it was dry training, I woke up 30 seconds or so later feeling like I'd had a head rush.

It's fun to pick an alcohol and an acid and just go for it, experiencing smells which are often much deeper and more complex than written language can describe.

tremendous_mango,2019-03-04,"It's definitely the right approach to learn first and buy later - it will save you a lot of money if you know what to get!

I learned about bees in Germany, so unfortunately I can't give you any advice on good resources in English. In my opinion, the best way to learn is from a local course or another beekeeper. A lot of things depend on your specific location, from the treatments that are allowed to how much you have to feed in winter. Even 50 miles can make a huge difference. Contact your local beekeeping association, they will be happy to help you out and point in the right direction.
If you don't have this option, I would prefer learning from a book. This is such a complicated topic that many youtube videos/online articles miss some crucial information. You will also get a lot of different opinions, sometimes the complete opposite of one another. I don't mean that online resources are all wrong or bad, but in my opinion books present the most complete and balanced information. Get a book, then look up topics online that you want to learn more about.

I took a course offered by the national beekeepers' association that took 10 whole-day sessions over a period of 9 months and that was just to cover the basics. It'S a lot to learn but absolutely worth it!",0.1161309523809524,Positivo

mcarterphoto,2016-07-25,"Y'know, I don't think I have many, or any? My wife and I always have two fat crossword puzzle books going, but that's 5 minutes here and there, pick one up and solve a few lines.

I'm a photographer/videographer/animator by trade, so (luckily!) my work feels ""hobby-ish"". I can get obsessed about learning new things, new software, etc. In my off-time, I do a lot of [fine art B&W shooting and darkroom printing](https://michaelcarter.photos) \- but I've made money at that and would like it to become more of my income than corporate work. If my work didn't have some kind of sales appeal, I don't know if I'd still do it as much. I really have this practical thing about being productive while having fun. 

My wife and I both cook, we may have dinner out once a month - that's got a hobby-ish vibe to it, but it's immensely practical while being challenging and fun. I've rebuilt a lot of the old wooden windows in our house, hobby-ish thing as far as getting better at a craft, but again - practical. 

This makes me think my brain is weird now that I think about it... is drinking wine with your wife while watching movies a hobby? Hell yes, I HAVE A HOBBY!!! Maybe it's a blessing, I can really enjoy things like doing tests of different films and chemicals, but there's an end-goal of ""finished art I can maybe sell"" through the process. It's like going to college for a career or something. I guess I'm very happy and excited though, everything I do is like ""roll up my sleeves and get better at this"".",0.21217992424242424,Positivo

MephistophelesOG,2023-04-04,"I am sooo a few months late... so I hope you don't mind my two cents!

* beer / wine / mead making. It may be a few month to a year plus opportunity to yield things, but may be worthwhile. I always enjoyed brewing mead as it was a drink fermented on honey (or more honey than sugar / maple syrup, etc.). I have long given up but something still interesting!
* gardening, either flowers or vegetables / herbs as to have something pretty to look at or use for cooking (I just harvested some cucumbers and pickled them with HIGH amount of spices... oops. I am thinking fried spicy pickles?) This has me doing something every few days, but having flowers as something pretty to look at everyday in the spring and summer is sooo worth it.
* walking public trails? Cross one off and go to another or just stick to one you enjoy the most. 
* camping or traveling - solo or with close friends / family
* journal. I have started in 2017 for one reason, but it transformed into many reasons soon after. I promise you that. Or even writing in general, if that is your thing by chance.
* audiobooks or podcasts. Now, I enjoy some of my audiobooks. ""Life is Pi"" is still one I think of fondly and often - even years after I listened to it. Some podcasts can be interesting as well, History for Weirdos is my favorite podcast, the 2 Be Better and Dr. Huberman podcasts are interesting as well! You may not have to focus 110% of the time, even doing chores or daily things with them in the background would be fine.

* book clubs at a local library! I haven't done so myself, but would like to try in September!
* find an in-person or online Dungeon's & Dragons group to play with. Hands down best thing I could have done. With attending an in-person group, I was able to go to a concert with one player and their spouse as we had a common interest in music. Other benefits: helps you get out of your shell as it is a roll playing game, you can design your character (via character sheet and what level the group is in) and act as them as well. Plus, at least the group I am in, there does not seem to be an intended end to it. (Fingers crossed!) Plus I have been planning to run my own games in D&D as well!
* attend concerts solo. I've enjoyed going to concerts solo before, and have had some confidence as of late to connect to fans in the general admissions areas (usually has no seating as per venue). Think of what your favorite bands are and see if they are playing near you. Maybe scroll through your Spotify / Pandora / Apple Music / YouTube / etc. to see if they are playing close by as well",0.18443121693121692,Positivo

For things that require a bit more of me I like going for nature walks, playing guitar, writing (highly recommend a typewriter for this, as they're just fun to play with even if you're just writing nonsense or your writing isn't going to be published), I'd like to get into painting but have yet to dedicate a time or space for it, and like most every 20-something dude playing videogames (mostly for the social interactions with my friends, as I don't have any single player stuff installed besides Dark Souls and Bloodborne). It's a healthy mix of options when I'm not busy working or spending time with my SO.

If nothing else I highly recommend checking out your local library's event calendar, as they're usually filled out with evening pastimes and they absolutely welcome first timers even if you're not very knowledgeable about the topic of the session. They have a healthy range of things like arts and crafts, some do gardening, there are reading groups, trivia nights, and some even host local governing board meetings if there's something you want to address in your community. They're always happy to have people swing by since they budget according to community usage, which is why everywhere on reddit librarians beg the public to come visit and help broaden their capabilities to serve the community.",0.2388293650793651,Positivo

Summer:
Graffitti (particularly I like to go biking and find random spots around town to graffitti, but nice art pieces not tags, don't be a doosh)
Hydroponic garden (building and maintaining it)
Building random things around the house out of pvc or wood like tables or light fixtures, etc
Falling fruit (an app that shows you where to find fruit trees or flowers in your city)
Uber (I find a lot of cool events and things to do by talking to locals)
Bird watching
Volunteering at Habitat Humanity (build houses)

Still good when it sucks outside like winter:
Snow boarding (or skiing)
Piano (I just search random songs on YouTube + ""midi piano"" and practice them)
Audiobooks while hiking
Rock climbing gym
Learn Chinese through Rosetta stone
Go to makerspaces that are located near breweries and build random crafts and drink.
Volunteering at soup kitchen or homeless shelter (theres one called Roots in Seattle I like to volunteer at bc they allow you to be creative)

And the usual things everyone tries to do like hiking camping gym photography cooking etc.

Overall I found my hobbies by watching YouTube, listening to audiobooks, Uber, riding trains and city buses and seeing new things, and volunteering. I'd suggest start there.",0.08321308321308322,Positivo

* Unreal engine can be a challenge to learn, but its not impossible
   * Their is easier game engines people recommend starting out (Godot, Unity), but I started learning Unreal Engine
   * The biggest advice I would give anyone looking to jump in is you must be persistant with your training (1 hour a night), but you also need to be forgiving to yourself.
      * Your not going to know anything right away (hell your not going to know everything at anytime!), but use your resources to find the solution.

&#x200B;

* If they are looking to learn to make games, the skills I would focus in on are:
   * Artstyle (really focus on what story or experience you want to tell, and how your visuals / audio are going to help express this).
   * 3d Modeling (Blender)
   * Learn Coding Basics (C++, learning the Blueprint Node system)

* Some Courses I would recommend when starting out on your journey:

Joatoat,2020-08-04,"Yard/estate sailing & resale. It's so much fun getting to peek into the lives of strangers and learn a little bit about their hobbies or livelihoods or just share a couple memories while making a couple bucks on the side.

I've learned a bunch about trains, duck decoys, lanterns and lamps, model building, dolls, cookware, tools, toys, art glass, retro holiday decor, paintball/airsoft, etc.

And I'm still learning more. I found an omega seamaster de ville watch with a Sunoco logo on the back. Now I get to learn about watches. I just learned two weeks ago what a salt cellar is. A couple years back I learned about old lady head vases made by Inarco & Ucago.

And a month back I found this guy. Most majestic wall hanging I've ever seen.

Token_Ese,2013-02-06,"Painting miniatures, Warhammer 40k to be specific.  

Yes, I'd recommend it.

--

My take on it: Mini painting has been around for decades, but started with RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons.  To try to get people to paint more, they came up with miniature games where you could field whole armies.  Warhammer 40k is basically Starcraft meets Star Wars Expanded universe and Lord of the Rings depth, all turned up to 11.  

The painting itself is a fun, creative outlet, and there are tutorials all over sites and youtube.  You can go simple, or get really detailed. You can paint just individual figures and devote a ton of time into it, or paint armies that include hundreds of figures. 

The lore is insane and a ton of fun. Everything is ""grimdark"", depressing, evil, dark, and just wild.  There really isn't even a ""good"" side, they are all just crazy in different ways.  

Just to cover the fractions you can play: 

* there is a human fraction, with about 30 major sub-fractions including 18 space marines fractions (and countless sub fractions), cyborgs from Mars, battle priestesses (think murder nuns), and various normal human armies fashioned after WWI trench warfare, WWII, Vietnam commandos, etc.; 
* chaos humans, which are basically humans who have mutated after worshipping the Chaos Gods; 
* there are elves (good, bad, and evil clown types), 
* orks who are actually from spores who just get off on constant war, 
* tyranids (""Zerg""), 
* aliens who fight in Gundam style mech, and 
* essentially terminator robots that are also zombies.

They have been churning out books, comics, games, and figures for 30+ years now, so the lore depths rivals other series like Marvel or Star Wars expanded pretty well.

I'd recommend to anyone who wants to start and they don't have a bike DON'T GET A MOUNTAIN BIKE THEY'RE NOT GOOD FOR ROADS. The cheapest road bike or even hybrid is better for roads than the most expensive mountain bike. Ofc if you already have a bike just use that (till you want an upgrade).

Photography, more specifically astroprotography.
Being outside under the stars in an area with little to no light pollution and seeing the milky way with the naked eye and taking really beautiful pictures that show so much more detail. Awesome. Or taking pictures of smaller and fainter objects you can't see, but the moment where you see them show up on your camera screen and you know you're gonna process and edit the hell out of it and that it's gonna look awesome... yeah it's great.

Also cycling with my camera in my backpack and snapping some shots whenever I come across something interesting

IMPORTANT EDIT: If you're thinking of starting cycling, make sure your bike seat is properly fitted!!!! Bike shops will usually do this for you with your measurements. It might not be what you're used to or comfortable with, but you'll be more efficient and reduce the risk of overuse injuries to your joints (namely your knees)",0.25243055555555555,Positivo

conalfisher,2016-03-27,"There's pretty much no app out there that's even half decent at teaching piano. Any app or website that says it can teach you how to play x in y weeks is lying or is missing the point of practice entirely. 

Start off by learning to read sheet music at a basic level, even if you don't intent to read sheet music, it's a very useful thing to learn, and while learning it you'll learn about all sorts of other important musical concepts, like key signatures, time signatures, and to an extent how chords are formed. Next try and learn some super simple classical pieces. Again, even if you don't care about classical music and don't intend to play it, just try it at the beginning. There's hundreds of years worth of study pieces made specifically to help your fingering, dexterity, finger independence, and so on. I believe Czerny wrote a ton of pieces specifically for total beginners that are well received but I don't really know. Regardless, there are enough simple Bach pieces out there, his prelude in C, Minuet in G (not by Bach but often attributed to him), and so on. And even then there's a huge wealth of more modern books specifically for beginners too, though their use dwindles pretty much after a few weeks.

Get a teacher if you can. That's the ultimate bit of advice you'll find for learning pretty much any musical instrument. It's the single most useful thing you can do. It's certainly possible to be self taught, it's just that without someone guiding you it's extremely easy to get into bad habits early on and just never fix them. If you can't get a teacher that's fine of course, but if you're really serious about learning the instrument and have the means, I'd highly recommend it.",0.10365646258503404,Positivo

College schedules are different from high school in the sense that you'll have occasionally have gaps in between classes that stretch a few hours. Going to your dorm during those times will KILL your productivity. 

It's much easier to get in the habit early of finding a comfy spot in the library or on campus to sit down and get some work done for an hour or two before you go to your next class. If you do that, and only go to your dorm after you wanna call it a day after your last class, you'll be miles ahead of everyone else doing the bare minimum. 

This is especially effective if you use that time to start working on assignments and essays shortly after they're assigned. It breaks down these huge, 10+ hour assignments into low-stress, one or two hour bursts that'll get done weeks before the assignment is even due.

Instead use every spare moment you get towards being productive. Even if it's only 20 minutes, you can use that to read some pages in your chapter, start outlining your essay, etc. If you have one hour between classes, try cramming in a quick workout so that you dont have to worry about it later when you get home which will open the evening for homework/being social.

From looking at pics online of it and with the knowledge they gave me over the phone, I was able to recreate it for her on a bad day as a surprise and that sealed the deal so to speak. She later told me that gesture alone was what changed her view of me. Led to a 3 year relationship and many more meals cooked


edit: since a few have asked, we had some great times but unfortunately we differed on a few key perspectives and values that would have affected our lives down the line too much.

Glass-Independent-45,,"A lot of celebrities were known players but very private about their servers/characters at it's popularity for good reason.  Known players were Ozzy Osbourne, Mila Kunis, Henry Cavill, Robin Williams, the lead for Cannibal Corpse and quite a few others I can't think of.  Point being is the game was massively popular in the west and was genre defining in that it lowered the bar to entry for games like everquest/ultima online at the time that were more restrictive.  It was a lot of peoples first MMO and such a big leap in how the world was built.  I wouldn't be surprised if more celebrities than we know of played.

If you think about it, it made sense that celebrities could interact with random regular people without ever needing to reveal their identity much easier.  Fame can be a curse for people who just want to be treated normally.

Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, Pirates of the Caribbean, Avengers, Star Trek, etc. Basically anything that needs to sound EPIC usually has some really great horn parts.
