Meanwhile, the car in 2nd closes to half a second when race track goes bendy, but can't overtake on the bendy bits because getting too close to another car during a car race makes car go slower. 

So... we're here to watch the best drivers in the world race each other, but the *actual race-y* parts of the race (i.e the bendy bits, parts of the track that showcase a drivers technical ability) have essentially had their potential for competitive racing neutralised by the current regs...

In the last reg set, Hamilton, Russell and Antonelli would've cruised through the field because the rest of the cars were basically in a different league and the front would've looked exactly the same because no one could pass.

Baybad,2014-06-03,"It didn't really.

Go for an overtake to advance your grid position by 1, with the chance that you destroy your car and start from the pitlane. Why would you risk it at all?

There are no championship points for pole positions normally, and that initial sprint race format which gave 1st, 2nd and 3rd minor points for staying in their qualified position was just dumb.

The only thing that would make sprints interesting is if they were more valuable than the race for the top drivers. Say 30 points for 1st down to 10 points for 8th. Everyone would drive like mad in that bottom 13 to get that 8th place, and the top would fight over the big bucks, knowing that they have a limited time, and the consquences of not attacking could be dire. 

But thats a fucking stupid idea because a 15 lap filler race would have more weight than a 60 lap main event.

strangebrew3522,2021-07-14,"> Except most people are employed and can’t dedicate 3 days to watching meaningful sessions. 

I mean no offense but, tough cookies for you. I have F1TV and can catchup whenever I miss it live, and on weekends I'm off and free to watch the Sprints. I'd much rather see cars racing than just mindless practice sessions. 

So yeah, the sprint was boring. That's not the sprint races fault, that's the fault of the regs. We're deep into this regulation period where all the cars are very similar in performance and once you get a DRS train going, there's little chance of breaking it. Maybe lets get new rules for Sprints only. Mandatory tire usage/pitstops. Something, anything just to shake it up a little bit.

He’s been getting that Ferrari into similar positions as his teammate for most of a very disappointing season. The way he’s talked about by some you’d think he was 12th in the Championship and miles off it.

It’s the twilight of his stunning career, he’s getting older, and yes, even as a big fan I can see and accept that. Not that he does.

UnderTakaMichinoku,2024-07-24,"Yuki finally having a near current spec car and his performance improves. I think people have forgotten that he's very rarely had a car anywhere near the spec that Max has had.

To my knowledge he had the same spec in Japan, Bahrain and Saudi (the latter duo he made Q3), he had it in Imola before they took the new nose off (Max's broke so they put it on his car) before qualifying and then he had a big crash that meant he then had essentially the pre-Imola car until Canada. Then he's had nothing new since Canada until today. Meanwhile the rest of the midfield have continued to bring upgrades making his job in that car even harder.

This is the tightest field we've ever seen where 2 tenths can make up 6/7 spots. I wondered yesterday if the new floor would have snuck him into Q3 yesterday and today we have that answer.

It's by no means perfect, but being thrown into qualifying today with 0 laps with the new floor, this is a good result. Hopefully he can convert it into solid points tomorrow.",0.1609090909090909,Positivo

Ferrari don’t have a car that can challenge for the title. It’s still probably 3rd best. Hamilton has been on a decline ever since 21. Some of that will be age, some of it may be lack of adaptability to the new era of cars. He finishes P6/7 because that’s pretty much where he is on merit. He’s not faster than Lando, Oscar, Max, Charles, or George in the top teams right now. 

He also needs to tone down his rhetoric which I understand is probably a hard mental shift. I don’t think he’s going to challenge for another title at this stage of his career. Focusing on a win or podiums should be the first goal. 

He’s not totally washed either. His quali lap got done because of a tight track limits call that didn’t really gain him much time. Before the DQ he was pretty much at Charles’ time. He’s also only 11 points behind Leclerc. 

He’s not a contender anymore. The question is if he’s willing to accept that and drive for the sake of it, like Alonso, or if he should accept it and retire.",0.16651184463684468,Positivo

Russell is a world class driver. But as other comment said, being 2-29 on competitive sessions is very concerning even if you are a rookie against a top driver, giving that you are expected to be a WDC in the future.

The talk about Max maybe taking his seat can’t have been good for his psychologicals. But at the same time, it’s lose-lose on the pressure front if you’re Kimi, isn’t it?

Checo: He was very mild in his criticism of checo, focusing on how Red Bull was really hoping he would regain form so that they could seal the constructor’s. That said, if Toto were giving quotes every week about how the team needs Kimi to find form so they can surge ahead of Ferrari and secure p2, I think people would say he was harping on about it a bit much, it isn’t something Kimi doesn’t already know, and it’s pointless to keep bringing it up publicly. 

Ricciardo: nothing readily comes to mind other than saying Ricciardo leaving for Renault was running from a fight. Something we all knew to be true.did it need to be said, there’s probably room for all manner of opinions on that. 

So I think it’s fair to say Horner doesn’t routinely slag off current RB stable  drivers or rip into them like Marko…..but there are times when he comments on their poor performance more (or more directly) than absolutely necessary. “We’re poring over the data, we’re committed to finding a solution, we know he’s capable of more than this and we feel we owe it to him to help unlock that performance” - these are more positive, non-quote-generating deflections than opining weekly on fighting for a WCC with one car. The driver in question is already acutely aware their poor performance is affecting the whole team — including staff morale and bonuses for example.",0.1438954274891775,Positivo

Blurandski,2015-12-16,"In races yes, but since Miami he's not come within a quarter of a second of Russell in race qualifying, and averaging .39s behind.

The thing that's worrying me is that while the first two races were a free hit, Japan-Miami he showed some pretty decent pace and looked to be on an upward trend (avg .20 behind), but since then he's gone into reverse - and that's as he's become more familiar with the car and is on tracks he has lots of experience on.

I suspect the concern in Brackley is shifting from whether he can challenge Russell to whether he's stuck in the Gasly/Albon doom loop (seeing themselves drop four tenths to their teammate, push harder, end up in the wall/gravel, lose further confidence in pushing the car, losses more speed and repeat).",0.1284722222222222,Positivo

Monaco needs a solution to make racing possible. They have a huge bay area and the city is constantly claiming area over the water to build stuff.

Le_Pistache,2017-10-23,"Not sure what to make of this race.

The additional stop did make the strategy battle more engaging at face value, but in the end we got the same 10, just with Alonso out with a power unit failure and Hamilton passing Hadjar in the pits.

VCARB and Williams just had a lot of control considering their track positions. They both pulled off the stops they were able to forge themselves brilliantly. Williams doing a switcheroo at Albon's second stop was honestly quite superb.

Mercedes were a bit ridiculous. Russell threw that strategy out of the window with a stupid decision to cut the chicane, but there was really nothing they, Sauber, and the individual other cars below VCARB and Williams could have done about it. The back up the pack strategy is too strong.

Otherwise Norris delivered a big win when he needed to do it. Three points separating the duo with Verstappen still lurking. Surely soon we will have a wheel to wheel battle between the two.",0.2004166666666667,Positivo

Verstappen has also been unlucky to a lesser degree this season. So when I saw Antonelli literally teleporting at the race start I had a feeling Verstappen was going to be in the danger line. Hope they get some good races coming up.

Other reactions - 

Bortoleto finally in points!! It was only a matter of time for him but really happy it's finally happened. 

Last time I saw Alonso looking this happy was in 2023? Brazil 2023 iirc? Super happy to see him celebrating Bortoleto's achievement 

Yuki heartbreak

Mercedes really needs an air conditioned tracks. If F1 is a winter only sport George is WDC

Ferrari upgrades are working!! They got more coming in Silverstone iirc so it will be interesting to see how it goes for them.

Fomentatore,2015-12-08,"Lando delivered the comeback he needed.

Piastri raced with hunger and brains. He lost the win by waiting way too long to pit in the first stint, but let’s see how he bounces back next time.

The opening duel was quality stuff: Oscar pushed Lando hard for 18 laps, and Lando didn’t put a foot wrong, not even at the start and he was impressive in the duel with Oscar he let him past in the best place and then retook the position back. Great respect from the both of them also.

Ferrari ended up best of the rest, more because Mercedes imploded. Kimi was gone immediately thanks to a ridiculous move at lights out, and the car just melts in the heat. It’s more a contest of who wants to lose P2 in the championship than who’s earning it.

Lawson did great. Only Red Bull driver to score points, lol.

Bortoleto was driver of the day. Scored points, amazing in qualy yesterday and then got absolutely schooled by Alonso in the final laps to get the experience he needs. 

Hulk in the points too, which says a lot. That Sauber is legit. Three races in a row in the points, it’s no longer luck. The car is solid, and the dev team is clearly doing their job. Strategy game has been on point too.

Red Bull is looking like they’re on suicide watch. If they lose Max, they might as well join Alpine at the back of the modfield.

The Sauber front right pit man has a serious case of restless-leg syndrome, and was pumped - fist bumps all round - a great result for the team and Bortoleto especially.

Lewis says he can stay out, then sets the fastest lap. A bugger for him - best result of the season and about two minutes of screen time.

Piastri and Colapinto are going to have words.

Yuki is in serious trouble, but as a development driver it was a good race. I’m expecting a move to Formula E.

Stroll needn’t bother either. At this point the new sponsors should point out that a one-driver team sucks.

Le_Pistache,2017-10-23,"McLaren dominated this race which was previewed yesterday when they were in a league of their own throughout qualifying. 

Norris with the best weekend performance he could have delivered after the last round. Dominant in qualifying and kept Piastri behind the entire race. His defense against him throughout that lap was excellent and decisive. 

Ferrari weren't at their level but clearly second best. Mercedes were nowhere. Poor move by Antonelli at the start.

Great race from Lawson and Alonso to pull off that one stopper to finish 6th and 7th respectively. I thought Sauber didn't quite react timely enough to their track position with Bortoleto.

But Bortoleto and Hulkenberg both had a strong race and result regardless. Props to Nico after a rather poor qualifying to get that result.

Ocon gets a points finish as his experience on Sundays tend to show over Bearman who makes little mistakes that cost him time. It will come with experience...

Alpine were quite bad today. It didn't seem that they could go fast on any tyre.  The less said about Williams the better. The good thing is that the next race weekend is right around the corner, so they can move on quickly from this one.

CabbageTheVoice,2013-06-18,"I think you can't just do that with every car. It's not that Max adds some pace to the car or whatever.

But It seems that RBR built a veeery ""narrow"" car, in that it can reach a very high performance but the tradeoff is that it is incredibly unstable. Max is able (perhaps through quick reflexes, fine senses or instinct) to keep the car in this narrow window consistently, allowing him to go a whole race with the car at very good performance.

If you can't consistently stay in that window and are in danger of slipping outside of it every once in a while, it will mean that you will probably go off track, land in a wall or make other mistakes. 
If that happens multiple times, you will automatically have to drive 'safer' in order to not crash out of a race. 

This is (I THINK) what the other RBR drivers are having to deal with. It's not that their usual pace is MILES off of Max, but that they can't drive to the limit of _their_ pace, as the car will lose consistency because they can't keep it in that narrow window as well as Max can. 

Basically, in gaming terms: RBR is a glass-cannon build and Max was grinding no-hit runs. 

Now, Max probably still also has some pace advantage over at least some of these drivers. So if you were to put him in an Alpine for example, it could be that he would fare better than their current drivers. 
But I would wager that he won't suddenly be in the top 3 just like that, as those teams haven't developed their car around Max's consistency, so they don't have such a high peak in the first place, and probably went for more of a more consistent car with a little less peak performance.

I am an armchair expert, everything I just said could be entirely wrong!

Le_Pistache,2017-10-23,"I don't think I've felt this happy for a driver in a long time. Gasly at Monza 2020 the last one.

Incredible from Hulkenberg, especially as he kept Hamilton behind when it looked so precarious. Lewis and co pitted a lap or two too early for dry tyres to be effective. Allowed a manageable gap and that's when it sank in that Hulkenberg was going to do it after 15 years. It was incredible and I am glad the terrible takes based on that stat are put to bed.

The Piastri incident is interesting. I think how quickly he braked on a wet track earned him that penalty. It was quite abrupt when you consider the location and conditions. 

Not Norris' finest win and the penalty liked robbed us of a fight for first as he was gaining on him. Don't know how Piastri reacts to that however.

Hulkenberg and Sauber will deservedly get all the plaudits, but Gasly was superb dragging that Alpine up there all weekend long.

Aston's clever thinking got Stroll in the mix just like Sauber with Hulk, but he dropped off quite rapidly. Reckon they wish Alonso was there instead. 

Terrible race management from Mercedes. Both drivers also struggled. Leclerc uncharacteristically poor.

I've been very critical of Lando at times, but he's kept his cool in this double header, and that's what wins you titles. These were a fantastic two weeks for him after a self-inflicted defeat in Montreal.

Le_Pistache,2017-10-23,"It was a fantastic race by Verstappen to frustrate the McLarens. He is simply excellent around Suzuka.

McLaren played it too safe. They can afford to when they have net gains on their rivals regardless, but still surprising to see given the options they had to play around with.

It seems like nobody wanted to go for free air when in losing positions. Red Bull should have pitted Tsunoda earlier to allow him to push on a bit.

I thought Antonelli was excellent. A well managed long first stint and he was flying during the second stint. Finishing a second behind Russell on your track debut is solid.

Good results for Hadjar and Bearman. Lawson was a bit slow on both his stints. A bit concerning on that front.

The race wasn't excellent unfortunately. The end could have salvaged it, but the tyres weren't falling off for anyone and McLaren couldn't get within DRS, with the midfield all settled after the stops.

EmergencyRace7158,2022-10-15,"Not a classic Japanese GP but I suspect we'll look back on this race and see it as a turning point in the WDC fight. My takeaways

\- This one was on Pirelli. They went way too conservative with the C3/2/1 tire selection. I suspect the C1 (hard today) could have done the full race distance with zero issues. A better selection would have been C2 (medium today) as the Hard, C4 as the medium and C5 as the soft.

\- Max is the favorite for the title. He's doing what he did in the 2nd half of last season and staying in touch while Red Bull improve the car. Yeah the RB21 isn't the McLaren but it's ahead of the Mercedes and Ferrari if they get the setup in the window - Suzuka is a fair benchmark for downforce and aero performance. Red Bull are widely expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the flexi front wing clampdown among the top 4 and if Max is within 25 points of the lead McLaren by Spain a 5th WDC is very much the expectation.

\- There's nothing between Oscar and Lando this season. They will keep taking points of each other as one or the other has a better weekend and this will play into Max's hands. Oscar threw away the pole and win with a mistake at T2 that cost him 0.3s on his final qualifying lap. I don't think McLaren could have won today regardless of strategy and they lost the race on Saturday.

\- Ferrari are a distant 4th fastest car at the moment. The China sprint pace was clearly from them running too low and they have some serious issues to sort out if they want to win races this year. They might be the first of the frontrunners to bin 25 and switch everything to 26.

\- Kimi continues to impress. Learned on track all weekend and performed when it mattered. He's going places fast and Toto has been completely vindicated in his move to promote him. Unless Max becomes available, this is the guy for Mercedes' future.

\- Yuki did okay. He was mostly just behind Max in terms of raw single lap pace but had a poor Q2 with Red Bull screwing him by sending him out on used softs first run and then making a mistake the second run. He'll be okay going forward in 25 but the pressure is really on for 26.

\- Hadjar had another really impressive outing and finally executed a full weekend. He has a lot of raw pace and needs to show he can deliver the consistency and maturity to bring himself into contention for a Red Bull seat in 26.",0.13082380204829183,Positivo

TalesFromTheGrid,2021-08-29,"A few thoughts from the race -

1) McLaren should have let Piastri have a go at Max, if he couldn't get it done then just swap them back.
2) Impressive drive from Hadjar as best of the rest.
3) Being out front in clean air is proving too much of an advantage given how the cars are affected by dirty air. Hopefully the new regs solve that.
4) As a fan, hearing that the tyres are thermal limited is not what you want to hear. It just means that drivers can only push for a few laps before they have to back off. I really think F1 need to look at tyres the drivers can push on all the time and then introduce mandatory stops. 
5) Good to see Kimi getting close to Russell, who once again barely featured in the coverage amusingly.",0.19885010822510824,Positivo

Arumin,2013-03-29,"> - There's nothing between Oscar and Lando this season. They will keep taking points of each other as one or the other has a better weekend and this will play into Max's hands. Oscar threw away the pole and win with a mistake at T2 that cost him 0.3s on his final qualifying lap. I don't think McLaren could have won today regardless of strategy and they lost the race on Saturday.

I think part is what might make this season like 2007.
McLaren have the best car, but they don't win the WDC as they take points off each other, leaving Max to take take it.

Kingdom818,2018-12-08,"Pitting on the same lap as Max wad inexcusable imo. Lando had good pace on the medium, but nobody was ever going to be able to pass without a tire offset. What happened at the pit exit was the best case scenario, overtaking in the pits would have been a very tall order.

If Lando would have gone long he could have potentially gotten a 10 lap tire advantage and had a chance to catch up and attempt a pass with an offset. (not how fast Antonelli was after his stop)

Maybe they wouldn't have won anyway, but they should have tried something because they were never going to win by pitting on the same lap.",0.3350000000000001,Positivo

Spockyt,2015-02-08,"I think you’re spot on about that. Mercedes were a bit complacent on strategy, so Red Bull learnt the skills to nab a win here and there, which serves them well now to turn a good result into a great one.

McLaren are in the mode of “let’s be happy with this good result” still, like they’re surprised to be P2, P3, rather than desperately trying to turn a P2 into a P1. Arguably they were better at that in the midfield, actually. Every now and then they’d pop up unexpectedly.
