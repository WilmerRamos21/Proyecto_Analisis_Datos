It was initially reported as magnitude 8.0 and later upgraded to 8.7 by the USGS. It is also considered the *eighth-largest earthquake globally* since 1900. The earthquake's epicenter was near Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and authorities issued tsunami warnings for several regions, including a tsunami advisory for parts of Japan and a tsunami watch for Hawaii

Updates: [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c3r4x9yrrg4t)

* **Waves hit US west coast** after Russian earthquake as Japan lifts tsunami warnings
* **Tsunami alert** in **Russia's far eastern peninsula** **lifted,** Kamchatka's emergency minister says the ""tsunami threat cancelled in Kamchatka""
* **Japan downgrades threat leve**l from warning level to ""advisory"" for **Kanto to Wakayama**
* **Nearly 2 million people asked to evacuate in Japan** Evacuation orders now stretch from Hokkaido to Wakayama. 
* **Russian region declares state of emergency** Sakhalin declares emergency after tsunami waves hit Severo-Kurilsk. 
* According to the US Geological Survey, at magnitude 8.8 this earthquake is tied as the **sixth most severe quake** in history.

* **China issues tsunami warning** Eastern China braces for 30cm to 1m waves. Authorities warn of possible coastal damage and ask residents to stay away from the shoreline.
* **Where the earthquake struck ‚Äì and how fast the waves travel** The 8.8M quake hit near Russia‚Äôs Kamchatka Peninsula at 11:25am local time. Experts say tsunami waves travel as fast as a jet meaning impact can be sudden and far-reaching."

DunnaMang,2022-12-27,"I live in Okinawa. Phone has been going bonkers with alerts. Hoping nothing serious hits here, but I‚Äôm nervous.

Update (1345 local time): not much activity on Okinawa. No additional sirens or phone alerts. The water looks the same as it did this morning. I appreciate all of the kind responses and well wishes in this thread. You folks are awesome!"
staticdresssweet,2024-12-09,"8.7 magnitude makes it one of the strongest in history. Also in a hotbed of a hotbed for seismic activity.

(Edit: ty for the upvotes, my phone is blowing uppppp! Also, the upgraded magnitude of 8.8 makes this tied for the sixth most powerful EQ in history, alongside 2010 Chile and 1906 Ecuador-Colombia. It's also the most powerful EQ since 2011 Tohoku.)

The 1952 Severo-Kurilsk earthquake, an 8.8-9.0, also occured 28 miles SE of this one. VERY active."

Looks like the worst hit was a town called **Severo-Kurilsk** if you want to look things up yourself. As far as I can see in the reports, everyone was safely evacuated to higher ground.

>*‚ÄúBy now, the ash plume has extended 58km [36 miles] east of the volcano. The volcano is continuing to erupt explosively at the summit. Ash emissions at altitudes up to 8km [4.9 miles] above sea level may occur at any time.

soylamaestra,2020-01-16,We had aftershocks for more than a month after the LA earthquake in 1994 and that was only a 6.7.
ZealousJealousy,2023-02-24,"For those who don't know or are interested: these are all likely along the same fault line, or very, very close. The line that this happened on is a subduction zone, meaning that a tectonic plate has pushed into another headlong (a convergent fault/boundary), causing a ton of pressure and tension to build up before one 'pops' over the other. Lots of subduction zones also occur in oceanic regions, which means a potential for tsunamis like we've seen with this earthquake. So there's an added layer of danger when these occur. 

Think of two flat discs of even width, literal plates. If you push them together very evenly, very deliberately on their thin side as hard as you can, you can probably keep them pushed together without moving for a bit. But if you have even a little unevenness in pressure... Well, all the energy you were using to push is gonna go somewhere. And oceanic crust is a lot more dense too, so the pressure - and the eventual release - is that much more intense than you get with a fault line where two plates are just sliding past one another (a transform fault/boundary)."

BlueGreenMikey,2016-06-20,"The 2004 Sumatra earthquake off the coast of Indonesia in the Indian Ocean killed nearly 300 people in Somalia after traveling for 3,000+ miles, landing 7 hours after the earthquake.

Even some Antarctic sensors noted 3-foot high displacements, and there were increased waves (not the kind that could hurt anyone) as far away as the Pacific coasts of Mexico and Canada."

1000LiveEels,2024-07-06,"> The walls were old but quite thick so they didnt break but they separated completely.

I wrote a really long article in the student newspaper in college about this *exact* concept relating to URM's (Unreinforced masonry). The main gist of it is that while the brick walls are sturdy in *static* loads (enough for entire factories to be made of brick), earthquakes cause horizontal and twisting movement.

The issue is that *so many* old brick buildings were only built with static loads in mind, which means that the floors **are not connected to the walls**. Basically, when the walls move the side in an earthquake, the floors just pancake on top of each other. This is especially bad in buildings over 3 floors tall, as each successive floor increases the force as it falls onto the one below it. 

This is the reason the earthquake in Christchurch in 2011 killed almost 200 people, largely because of old brick buildings falling on people.

The good news is it's actually pretty well documented and known how to reinforce these buildings, it's just a *really* intensive process that requires people to basically evict tenants until they're done, so most politicians steer clear of it unless they can get public support for it. It can also be pretty expensive. A guy I spoke to gave me a figure in the 7-digit range on fixing his apartment building, which was 5 stories. 

Honestly (and I'm being super serious here) I would NEVER go in a brick building built between ~1880 - 1940 if you live in an earthquake prone area. Like not once, just because when an earthquake happens you will probably just be crushed to death."

ignatious__reilly,2013-09-09,"The news is reporting 3 meters‚Ä¶‚Ä¶3 meters is massive especially when measured out in the open ocean prior to hitting land. 

This is what happens as a tsunami shoals. In deep water, tsunamis are extremely long waves and often barely noticeable in height. But as they approach shallow coastal areas, their energy compresses, forcing the wave upward, dramatically increasing its height.

This is why reported wave heights can be misleading. A 10-foot tsunami in open water might not seem extreme, but by the time it reaches shore, it can be devastating.

Unlike regular waves, which are generated by wind and affect only the ocean‚Äôs surface, tsunamis involve the entire water column, from surface to seafloor. They don‚Äôt always break like normal waves, but instead bring a relentless surge of water. And most importantly, tsunamis rarely consist of a single wave, multiple waves can arrive, sometimes spaced minutes apart.

So when you hear certain wave heights being reported, remember‚Ä¶..the numbers alone don‚Äôt tell the full story."
Infrastation,2014-04-11,"This is in the Kuril trench, which means the tsunami will likely be much smaller in Japan than in Russia on the peninsula.

v = ‚àö(9.8 √ó 4000) ‚âà ‚àö39200 ‚âà 198 m/s ‚âà 443 mph

So in deep water, tsunami waves can travel at speeds of 400‚Äì500 mph (640‚Äì800 km/h)‚Ä¶

_M3SS,2019-03-17,"WARNING: LONG ASS STORY, TOO LAZY TO CHECK FOR GRAMMAR.

Chilean here as well, I was 12 by 2010. Lived 100km south of the epicenter. 
I had a headache the night before so I went to sleep early, something I rarely did during summer. All I remember was waking up with the deafening sound of a freight train coming from below. 
My dad went to pick me up in my room and I asked him if we were in war or if I was having a nightmare. House was made out of wood, which while not optimal, wasn't the worst material to deal with an earthquake, but we had to get out instantly. We heard blasts from the electric transformers exploding and lines collapsing. We were out during the first 30 seconds and my mom couldn't stay standing.

I remember grabbing a fence to stand still while my dad had to get my grandma out of another house with a much heavier door. All of this while the roar and movement was still going. He managed to get her out as well, and we had no serious injuries. My dog kept trying to calm my mom by staying at her side and licking here haha.

The house stood the earthquake surprisingly well, broken glass across the floor but we had roof tiles above a false roof which made us believe it would collapse on top of us.
The next hours later you had the same roaring sound every 2-3 minutes coming with more and more aftershocks, while my dad was trying to get inside tp pick up a radio and save whatever item we could save. We sat in the backyard while holding candles and trying to send text messages to our family members. 

The radio related mind-blowing news, like the collapse of a new 15 story building built right in front of where some of my mom's family lived. Which btw nobody even heard collapse, only the screams and the panic afterwards. We lived somewhat coastside but not close enough to be exposed to the expected tsunami which ended being dismissed in a first instance, just to be backtracked like an hour later.

We ended talking with our neighbors and I fell asleep like 9AM with the fear of the earth shattering below us. The next day we heard the stories about several story builds collapsing or heavily damaged, the tsunami hitting across 200-300km of the coast. Two bridges iirc collapsed as well, minutes after a cousin of mine crossed one of them, looting started to occur around different areas, train tracks completely deformed and roads split in half. It was like a warzone. We slept in tents for like a month after. And we had no access to clean water/electricity for like a week or so. It's definitely the most dystopian and bizarre experience I've lived. The whole town where I grew up, looked like something out of a movie. 

People started helping out each other, and slowly but surely life started to go back normalcy. I still remember seeing some of the most beautiful night skies I've ever seen, some hidden beauty brought to life by a disaster. Funny enough, I ended up becoming a geologist, not because of it, but it is something that raised my curiosity about it."
Winter_Departure3169,2024-07-02,In my city (Santiago) the earthquake was 8.0 and it was insane It is a sensation that is hard to explain but it felt like someone was making waves with the floor.

I personally have not done any research on the matter to comment as to its accuracy, but any way you interpret it, it's amazing to think of these cultures having precolumbian contact given the insane distances involved."

Same with the 2011 Japan quake, 8.8 to a 9.0-9.1. (2) the 2011 Japan quake did have tsunamis throughout the Pacific coastal areas, but tsunami warning systems are significantly better in the Pacific Ring of Fire than to the eastern Indian Ocean. This is for a couple of reasons: more first-world coastline and more earthquake activity (leading to more attention). It was also 7 years after Sumatra, and there were upgrades in science and tech. (3) The 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami actually killed one person in northern California who did not heed the warnings and wanted to photograph the tsunami. He was taken out to sea and was found 300 miles north in Oregon a month later. The tsunami caused millions of dollars of damage in the US."

Most ocean waves are movements of water at the surface. Essentially, if you dive underwater you are less affected by the waves. However a tsunami is a disruption and movement of the entire depth of water, so the force required to do that is quite massive.

It's why even a 1 meter/3 ft tall tsunami can still drag a person out to sea. It's not like standing in a 1 meter deep part of the ocean, it's significantly stronger."

_V0gue,2023-07-15,"Correct! But it also loses energy quicker than in air. And travels fastest through solids but loses energy quickest. That's because sound is just molecules vibrating against each other and passing it along. So the tighter the molecules the faster that ""message"" travels. But it also dissipates quicker as energy is lost to friction. You may already know this, but in case anyone was curious!"

maccaroneski,2016-12-29,I love going out to Mavericks to watch the 60 footers in winter. The noise is incredible. Of course knowing that you're perfectly safe at the viewing distance makes it quite different.
Forward-Surprise1192,2021-11-24,"I saw a video on TikTok of the flood in Texas and the wall of water was maybe 6 or 7 foot high. There were people standing in front of a door outside of a building.
It literally smashed the door down and hit them so hard they were gone in a second."
syadoz,2013-10-17,I am seeing some reports from the inhabitants. Apparently they were mostly evacuated after the tsunami warning. A kindergarten collapsed but there were no children at the time https://charter97.org/ru/news/2025/7/30/650134/
Zebidee,2011-09-27,">I hope the alarms went off soon enough for people to get to safety. 

No, the opposite. 

They were mostly settlers from European Russia, so had little experience with tsunamis. 

When they felt the earthquake, they ran to the hills, so were safe from the first wave, but returned to the town just in time to get hit by the second wave. 

2,336 out of 6,000 inhabitants were killed."
willardTheMighty,2022-06-24,"Yeah, it looks like the tsunami would hit around 1:00 AM if it does hit. Maybe I should warn the homeless people who sleep in the area

Edit: USGS says no large waves are expected"

BlueGreenMikey,2016-06-20,"Yeah, depending on the island, many of them have good coverage from other islands blocking the way. If this ends up being a bad tsunami, it's totally possible some islands in the area will suffer little to no damage. Shelfs and water depth also matter. If you look at the 2004 tsunami, it's crazy how one island gets completely destroyed while one just a short distance away suffered almost nothing."

Level9TraumaCenter,2016-10-29,"[Richter magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_scale#Details) was originally designed to interpret the energy one one fault line, using one specific type of instrument.

>The Richter scale was defined in 1935 for particular circumstances and instruments; the particular circumstances refer to it being defined for Southern California and ""implicitly incorporates the attenuative properties of Southern California crust and mantle.""[34] The particular instrument used would become saturated by strong earthquakes and unable to record high values. The scale was replaced in the 1970s by the moment magnitude scale (MMS, symbol Mw‚ÄØ); for earthquakes adequately measured by the Richter scale, numerical values are approximately the same. Although values measured for earthquakes now are Mw‚ÄØ, they are frequently reported by the press as Richter values, even for earthquakes of magnitude over 8, when the Richter scale becomes meaningless."

itsokaysis,2022-07-03,"Might not be accurate but as of 45 mins ago, Hawaii is alerting residents to evacuate in some areas and expects some destruction. Alaska also has a current warning in effect, meaning waves are expected.

>The first tsunami wave is forecast to reach Hawaii just after 7:15 p.m. local time, which is 1:15 a.m. ET. Destructive tsunami waves are expected, according to Oahu Emergency Management. 

>People are urged to evacuate coastal areas, according to officials. Residents in Honolulu were urged to evacuate the primary evacuation zone or go to at least the fourth floor of a building."

livinghereinaflower,2023-06-30,"There is a specific layer or channel in temperate ocean regions known as the SOFAR (SOund Fixing And Ranging) channel, where sound travels at its furthest without transmission loss, it‚Äôs usually between 600 - 1200 m deep. Whales use this channel for communication -  temperature, pressure, and salinity are all factors in sound transmission. Part of my job is to use hydrophones (underwater microphones) to detect snd record cetaceans near in-water construction works, as well as measuring how loud underwater drilling and piling activities are to make sure they aren‚Äôt too loud for marine mammals and fish. Sound can literally cause fish swim bladders to rupture!"
