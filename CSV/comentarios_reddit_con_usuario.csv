Bartok_and_croutons,2018-06-07,"God, I wish people were more informed about why the U.S is involved in this war. A lot of people ask (rightfully so) ""Why are we even involved with Ukraine? Not our problem."" 


And the answer is Ukraine is in this situation because of assurances made by the U.S. During the formation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We made them the promise that should Russia become an agressor, we would provide them with all the economic, military, and political support they need. 


We got them here by convincing them to give up their nuclear weapons. And it'd be more than a bit fucked up to leave Ukraine out to dry because of it.

If they weren't such assholes, they could talk more civily, but this was their plan. They wanted it to go like this and shift blame.

derpandderpette,2011-12-11,Trump is an embarrassment
nuboots,2020-06-17,"it was never going to go differently, and all those diplomats and reporters were either painfully naive or desperate. 

Trump had the leverage and he knew it.  He has never NOT twisted the knife once he had it in.  He's spent the last week being told by the British and the French how key the USA is to this process, and then Zelensky shows up to give him a minerals deal without any firm commitments in return.  Everything there said that they needed him more than he needed them.  

And Trump holds a grudge.  Forever.  Listen to the tape and hear him ranting about Hunter Biden.  He's still mad at the Ukrainians about that and probably blames them for getting him impeached.  

Trump was always going to take the minerals deal, and then make Zelensky concede more and more, before finally having him resign.  and then Trump would renege and back Putin anyway, because Zelensky gave up everything of value before leaving, and ""that's just smart business.""

Two maybes out of many:

1) The Europeans pull it together and back the Ukrainians.  If that works out, then we're looking at the new NATO without the US involved.  Welcome to the new western hemisphere, where the USA is just another participant and no longer playing the tune.

2) Zelensky has Vance whacked.  He could probably get away with it: the VP is a nobody, and Vance is just a little bitch no one likes.  Just invite him to a summit somewhere that overflies near Ukraine, and put a missile into his plane.  ""oh, no, those darn russians shot down another airliner..."""

relytbackwards,2016-10-07,"Imagine you are a relatively small country and you are invaded by a HUGE country to the north and then one of your strongest allies that you rely on for security calls you a dictator and starts to walk back their aid. Then you are forced to negotiate with a pair of bone headed, privileged losers who don't care about your struggle and would rather sell their souls to the highest bidder for some power and real estate deals. All while you are fighting a war to protect your country and the lives of its very people. THAT is what's happening here. Trump has never had to take on true leadership. He is a poser and a loser. 

No matter what you think of Ukraine and Zelensky, this is beyond disrespectful and embarrassing. 

What a fucking joke our country is with Trump as the head and it only took one month for the shame and embarrassment to rear it's ugly head."

Capital_Werewolf_788,2022-08-07,"It’s impossible to defend Trump here, the fact is that Ukraine signed the 1994 Budapest Memorandum along with the US and Russia, and while this agreement is NOT a binding defense treaty, it included security assurances from the US and Russia in exchange for Ukraine giving up their nuclear weapons. Russia broke that agreement by invading Crimea in 2014, and again in 2022. While the US are not obliged to respond militarily (and they didn’t), they sent billions in aid, which should be recognised as a part of their security assurance to Ukraine in the 1994 agreement. So for Trump to act like the US is doing Ukraine a favour is utterly absurd.

I do think that for there to be peace, realistically there has to be some compromise. Ideally you would want Russia to return Crimea, but that is never going to happen when Ukraine has no leverage here. A realistic compromise would be for Ukraine and Russia to return back to their pre-war borders in 2022, for Ukraine to declare neutrality and not join NATO, for the US and Ukraine to sign that minerals deal that would give Trump the profits (supposedly, no idea how valuable this deal even is) while ensuring American interests remain in Ukraine, and for Russia to once again guarantee Ukraine’s security, with the US putting in writing what the consequences of Russia breaking the agreement will be. That is the security guarantee that Zelensky needs, something more concrete than the 1994 agreement.

That doesn’t seem to be the direction Trump is taking. He’s acting like a bandit here, he wants a mineral deal with Ukraine but he doesn’t want to dip his feet into their affairs, seeing how he continuously refuses to offer security guarantees. He’s operating in bad faith."
Derridead,2021-03-02,"Vance and Trump instigating a fight to make Zelenskyy look bad. Obviously it didn't work as Zelenskyy kept his cool, but the Trumpers will now see 'dictator' Zelenskyy as ungrateful and confrontational for not rolling over for their god emperor.

Edit: Donald Trump is trying to normalize land grabs, and support Russia’s attempt to rewrite history by spreading lies. Russia invaded Ukraine, it is not the other way around. Originally they said that they were invading because sharing a boarder with NATO was somehow a threat to Russia. We can prove this is a lie, because now Russias boarder with NATO is less defended than is ever has been in history because all of their military is concentrated in Ukraine. If NATO was a threat they would have trench lines and military personal along the NATO boarder ready for invasion. 

Edit 2: They invaded because they want as much power and control as they can grab, and it is not in the interest of the United States or democracy everywhere to sell out our closest Allies to Dictatorships and Authoritarianism for instant gratification and monetary gains. Especially during a time where the United States is seriously gearing up for war with China over Taiwan, we need strong relationships with as many long time allies as possible. Russia will not help us in the ways Donald Trump is helping Russia. Donald Trump must be stopped - if you don’t have time, you have money; if you don’t have money you have time. If you decide to do nothing, the future will be decided for you by the most powerful and greedy people alive at the time of writing."

I am talking about the scene with the tank's commander and a higher ranking officer discussing a battle plan. At some point the officer says ""Why don't they just give up?"" To which the tank commander says: ""Would you?"" 

Honestly wondering how when an American refuses to lay down his weapons to defend his country it's patriotism, but when someone who is facing an actual invasion refuses to lay down arms it's ""a dictator who keeps dragging on the war"". You Americans do realise that surrendering would mean handing over a third of Ukraine to the Russians, including the millions of people, businesses and homes that are in said third?"

This isn’t about right vs wrong, morals, or empathy. It comes down to publicly embarrassing someone and being an “alpha”.

I would argue that by Trump planning this whole scheme, taking questions mainly about what Zelenskyy wears and praising far right news, has shown how immature and fragile he is. He can’t even talk to CNN without falling into his CNN stims about how they’re bad and failing. When someone stands up to him, he absolutely melts, like parents when they realize they are wrong but won’t let the kid win when the argument goes on, so they just yell and repeat the same things.

Edit: spelling"

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/media/tass-russian-state-media-oval-office/index.html

Whos TASS? Why its russian state media.

>A correspondent for TASS, a Russian state media organization, was among a group of hand-picked pool reporters present in the Oval Office for the leaders’ meeting, which is part of the US’ efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. The testy Trump-Zelensky sit-down may yield a signed deal that would exchange US access to Ukraine’s mineral resources for security guarantees.


>Though the group of pool reporters in the Oval Office was hand picked, the White House has denied the TASS staffer was permitted entry.

>The apparent gaffe comes three days after the White House announced it would wrest the choice of pool reporters from the White House Correspondents’ Association, breaking with decades of precedent. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, promoted the move as democratic on Tuesday, emphasizing that the WHCA “should no longer have a monopoly over the privilege of press access at the White House.”"
