Thegreatgonzo412,2016-09-21,"That's not just ""an"" anime that that's ""every frame a painting"" anime Akira."
Rioma117,,"That's not ""an anime"", that's Akira, it took tremendous amounts of work and the movie almost caused bankruptcy of the studio but it was worth, the final product was the most influential Japanese movie of the 80s and early 90s and it made Japanese animation popular in the west. The special effects still look well to this day."

Magikarp_King,2015-09-08,Hand drawn is and always will be the best anime for me. You can really tell when a team comes together to creature something truly unique and beautiful. It just has a feel to it that you can't get in anime today. I still love anime today but nothing gets me back to those late nights on toonami or the lucky days we would catch something on cable.

PixAlan,2015-04-15,"r/confidentlyincorrect

Anime shows were always pumped out at a pretty fast rate, without digital methods the faster developed shows were limited to very simple animation over static painted backgrounds(technique you see in this video), also the artists were paid very little and usually by frame(still the case today), while more complex animation was limited to big budget movies(studio ghibli, akira etc). Today with digital even fast developed shows can have complex animation and dynamic scenes."

HolycommentMattman,2014-04-01,"? That's not true at all unless you're talking about something like DBZ or Sailor Moon. Because those were special cases. The anime were already done, ABC only picked up two seasons, though. For example, the first episode of DBZ aired in the US in September 1996. The last episode of DBZ aired in Japan in January 1996. 

The only reason we had to wait a decade for the rest of it was because of that 2 season rule by ABC. 

Otherwise, anime was on a pretty constant flow. To the point where they would just make anime episodes if there wasn't manga written yet. Only recently have anime started waiting for the manga. Probably due to the very negative reactions from filler in Naruto, Bleach, and Fullmetal Alchemist."

The amount of detail put into it is not the same as anime series like Ranma 1/2 and Dragonball. Those still took a while, but in terms of artistic detail, it’s like comparing Berserk to One Piece."

PeopleCallMeSimon,2020-05-01,"The One Piece anime has been going strong for 22 years, not really having seasons but releasing something like 48 episodes per year.

How long it takes to create an anime season depends on a lot of things. Is the story written already? Was the new season pre-approved or do the producers have to wait for confirmation if a new season is ordered or not? How long is the season and the episodes? And of course, quality of animation.

eirtep,2012-07-23,"> years ago it would take decades to have a second season

That’s not really true at all and you’ll notice a clear quality shift between stand alone animated movies like Akira and your average anime tv series from the same time period. They came out regularly just like any tv show would - Dragon Ball had 9 seasons / 150+ episodes from 1986-1989. 

I'm sure there are examples of long stretches between seasons for other shows but for your standard, serialized tv show they were pumped out fairly regularly."

And even today a lot of the key art is still hand drawn and scanned in."

For just a minor scene of a few seconds where two characters meet on a bridge, a whole city was painstakingly designed to fill a backdrop that you can barely see through a sliver between two huge buildings in the foreground.

The attention to detail of this masterpiece verges on insanity. And despite all its influence and accolades i still feel it's very much underaprecciated. I've tried often to impress on friends how spectacularly important it is and so few have actually come back to me after watching it with positive feedback.

A three-stage, liquid-fueled rocket, the Saturn V was developed under the Apollo program for human exploration of the Moon and was later used to launch Skylab, the first American space station. As of 2021, the Saturn V remains the only launch vehicle to carry humans beyond low Earth orbit, as well as the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful (highest total impulse) rocket ever brought to operational status.

tetsuo9000,2010-09-17,">thought astro boy and speed racer did that

This wasn't the era of Wikipedia. Hardly anyone knew those were ""Japan"" shows, or what anime ""was"" so, while the shows were popular, the medium wasn't promoted. You really didn't see the spread of the medium marketed as anime until the 80's and, especially, the 90's. Similar to Speed Racer, westerners look back now on shows like Transformers and Star Blazers and retroactively refer to them as anime with their origins in mind, but during their airings they were just cartoons. 

Akira was a break through moment for anime in the west. It was one of the first where the setting of the show was firmly Japan without any Americanizations to adapt the show."

TheDerped,2012-09-23,"Akira itself wasnt a big budget film either. People for ages thought that the film had a 1.1 billion yen budget which is big for an anime movie at the time [but the producer confirmed last year that its around 700 million yen.](https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/06/08-1/akira-anime-film-producer-corrects-30-year-fact-on-how-much-the-groundbreaking-film-cost-to-make ) A similar budget to Castle in the Sky which came out around the same time.

Heck even Ghost in the Shell cost around the half that amount 10 years later"
Kom4r,2017-09-17,"It cost around $31mil in 1979. which would be around $115mil today which ranked it 6th that year, with Alien surpassing it by a small margin. For comparison, Superman was 1st at $55mil, which is around $205mil today. $150-200mil is still the amount the top movies are working with in 2021, but more with green screen and CGI, less filming on-sight and made up studio locations.

[eliminado],,that prolly only saves like 5% of the total effort
Three_Headed_Monkey,2011-09-23,"I've seen interviews with Disney animators how the decision to reuse animation was a quirk of a few directors who liked to do so as it didn't really save time or effort. You had to spend time searching the archive for the stills of the scene that they want, you can to trace and copy it out with the new characters, which still took time to do, so all in all wasn't really that much less effort than just coming up with something new.

It was rarely used as a real time saving measure. That's just speculation from people who noticed the reused animations and didn't actually work on the product."
marji4x,2017-03-01,"As an animator I can say that while this does save a lot if time it still takes a lot of time too. Someone who still had to know how to draw well (and animate) had to trace over the original animation with the new character, animate any extras that weren’t in the original (new hair style or different clothes) and keep the new character on model and consistent (a skill which requires both drawing and animation finesse)

What tie you gained was that the animator didn’t have to plan out the timing of the motion or research the movement; this does save time. But this kindof stuff was still a lot of work. 

It also wasn’t done for that many shots per production. It definitely wouldn’t mean the studio could now cut their production time by years."
spacemudd,2015-12-06,"But you see how OP's logic falls apart? If One Piece first aired in 1999 with season 1, then we'd expect only 2 more seasons since then, so about 48 episodes... not 1000 episodes.

The lengths of these shows (one piece, naruto) is due to all the filler episodes and side-stories there are."

These days, 12 episode seasons are pretty common with a 1+ year break in between.

Eusocial_Snowman,2021-11-29,"Akira will hold your interest, even with how weird it gets. Cowboy Bebop if you're looking for whacky Noir in space with great choreographed fight scenes and the like. That one is a whole series, though, not just a movie.

For the more fantasy leanings, go for Princess Mononoke. That title has scared off a lot of people back in the day, but it's not girly stuff. It's also not European fantasy, with everything being asiany still, but it's just fuckin good.

Now, don't ask about anime on reddit again. You'll be swamped by a bunch of people trying to convince you to watch a bunch of god awful things and making really convincing arguments about why they're great, and it will all be cringy nonsense that will make you feel like you're about to be arrested for watching it.

Akira, Mononoke, Bebop. Nobody has ever not liked any of those. There's more good stuff, but it gets more and more ""love it or hate it niche interest"" from there."
TherronKeen,2021-08-20,"Ok, so when it comes to anime, the ""ultra-high production quality, popular in 80's America"" movies will generally appeal to an action/sci-fi fan even if they're not into ""anime"" as a thing.

Akira is arguably the masterpiece of the group, and for good reason. Absolutely breathtaking art, writing, and cinematography. It gets *very* deep, *very* rapidly - so if you've ever enjoyed a psychological thriller or an insane sci-fi flick with body horror, you should be blown away. Watch Akira if you enjoyed the classic 80's & 90's blockbuster sci-fi scene, but be prepared for an underlying foundation of transhumanist philosophy. *note: there is a fanboy debate about whether to watch the original English dub, the remake English dub, or subtitles - but watch whatever you want. I've seen all three versions several times and anybody who would nitpick about that shit is usually just being nostalgic or elitist.*

Ghost in the Shell is the anime equivalent of the book ""I, Robot."" It's a near-future semi-dystopia cyberpunk action flick that goes from ""what is the nature of humanity in an android?"" to ""Jesus Christ I didn't know you could make a gun shoot that many bullets"" and back again in a hot minute. If you liked The Matrix and literally any movie with androids asking questions about their own existence, watch it.

Ninja Scroll is the defining film when you need to demonstrate the term ""hyperviolence."" It is an over-the-top bloodbath cranked up to 11 and then you keep twisting the dial until it breaks. Also a constant supply of intense sexual violence, so be aware. The action is front seat to the writing, which isn't an incredible narrative feat, but we're not here for the prose. If you've ever enjoyed any ninja movie, get it now. This is what largely inspired Kill Bill's action scenes, which are painfully tame compared to the source material.

Lastly, we've got a twofer - Vampire Hunter D, the 80's original, and the newer film Vampire Hunter D : Bloodlust. A lot of the animation on the older film feels dated, but it's still beautiful and an enjoyable, violent romp through a post-apocalyptic far-future vampire world. I've only watched it a couple times but it's recommendable if you enjoy the rest of the list, I guess.

VHD Bloodlust is a brutal trek across the same wasteland, and has a star-studded voice cast for the English dubs that is buttery smooth. It has some interesting blend of fantasy and technology in the narrative backdrop which provides a fantastic medium for storytelling about a half-vampire who is comparably split between the world of man and nightmare. The action is solid, but nothing near the intensity of the other films, which actually isn't an insult by any stretch. I like the original film but I'll vouch for Bloodlust 100%. If you like any vampire films at all, from Lost Boys to Interview with the Vampire to Nosferatu, watch it. Oh, and my god, what a soundtrack.

Definitely aware of my own fanboy/used-car-salesman vibe right now but dude, if you're not into anime and you watch these 5, you can stop right there because the rest of anime just might let you down, forever. Cheers dude, and enjoy.

EDIT: And yes, another commenter mentioned Princess Mononoke. It is produced by Studio Ghibli which has won more awards for every aspect of film production than the number of words in this post. I'd recommend Princess Mononoke if you want a cultural fantasy with a much more developed narrative about nature VS industry, plenty of action without being excessive, and some of the smoothest art AND music in the entire genre. If you love watching Princess Mononoke, then definitely move on to other Ghibli films - including Howl's Moving Castle, which I'd call a steampunk-light London-esque magical adventure - it's a wonderful take on humanity in the grip of greater economic, political, and magical forces but it doesn't bog you down in the gritty bits of any of them. And the food... the best animated food on earth, hands down - and the fact I'd take the time to point out *animated food* should indicate how striking it is! Cheers!"
GuyNekologist,2017-07-22,"Man, you're in for a wild ride. I'll just add a few robot genres to the list of other comments.

Want action and existential crisis mechas? The classic Evangelion.

Want something that shows the horrors of war? Gundam. Iron Blooded Orphans is a nice entry to the franchise.

Want an intense one which makes you wrack your brain? Code Geass

Want an all around well written boy meets girl sci fi? Eureka Seven

Want one with nonstop over the top energy? Gurren Lagann"
Dettelbacher,2014-06-03,"Never really liked anime, but Akira is one of my favorite movies. Only thing that comes close is Princess Kaguya."
Sunny_Blueberry,2015-10-23,"The old anime movies are great when it comes to artistic detail, but their plot is also good. Nowadays i can't stand anime, because 90% of the runtime is superfluous and doesn't push the story forward, nor does it help character development. Maybe the reason for that is the cheap and fast way of animation that is possible in the current age."
ahiroys,,Check out Redline.
fungah,,"Akira is what convinced me that all anime isn't terrible. That there may be other good anime out there. 

So I've went from thinking anime was nothing but garbage across the board to having found some animes I've actually liked. 

I'm now firmly in the camp that only 95% of anime is terrible, and that there's some real great gems buried in that massive turd pile."
1ifemare,2015-01-08,Thank you!!! I was convinced the title was completely different. Couldn't find it no matter how much i googled.

It's fascinating :)"

For a live action, it wasn't quite as bad as I expected, but still pretty bad. I feel like if I didn't see the anime prior to watching it, I may consider it a very decent show, but still, 5.5/10."

the live action isnt close as good as the original, but id be dumb to say i didnt appreciate a bit more of that universe..."
TokiMcNoodle,2015-06-18,Weebs are the biggest tightasses when it comes to a live action adaptation for any anime ever made.
onesneakymofo,2011-04-07,"Sorry you're right. Let me realign so I'm on topic:

In terms of influential animes, you're literally putting it as your #1 which is asinine.

It came out in the mid 90s well after other influential animes already defined what anime was. 

What makes Eva special to you so much that you put it at #1?

It's a mech anime... Gundam was what propelled Mecha in the 80s.

Its plot? So many other animes before it had a much better story.

The only thing about it that makes it stand out was its controversial ending which is heavily influenced by Devilman.

Everything from anime isn't derivative from Eva as Eva is derivative itself."

PudPullerAlways,2021-05-08,"I feel like a lot of the look for me is in the lineart because the drawing gets rammed through an xerox machine to get it on ""cellulose"".

rockstar323,2012-07-25,I watched it at my friend's house on Laserdisc when I was around 10. His dad was a Dr. and had this insane man cave with a giant TV and sound system. It was one of the most memorable movie watching experiences of my life.

RedDemocracy,2015-05-30,"I spent a couple minutes trying to think of anything to refute your last two paragraphs, and all could come up with is *maybe* Nausicaa as a sci-fi offering to replace Princess Monoke’s fantasy.

Other than that, yup. Even if you don’t like the medium of anime, these are still good. Anything else is going to be dependent upon how tolerant you are of the medium itself."
Ralzar,2019-12-05,"This is so painfully true. I like anime as an art form but trying to ask anime fans about good anime? Forget it. Anime fans is like if we had “Hollywood fans” that could reccommend you movies made by Hollywood but with no real grasp of what makes a movie good or not.


That said, you could include “Paprika” in the list of anime sci-fi. It and “Perfect Blue” (which is not a scifi) are perfect examples of how the animated movie medium can do stuff that even modern high-quality CGI would be hard pressed to emulate."

IHaveSpecialEyes,2013-01-25,"> note: there is a fanboy debate about whether to watch the original English dub, the remake English dub, or subtitles

I grew up with a VHS copy of the original English dub, so that was what I watched. When they remastered it in the early 2000s and released it in a special tin, I snatched that up only to be dismayed that there wasn't an option to have the original English dub. I've got absolutely nothing against the redubbing, it's just that I was used to ""kuh-nay-duh"" not ""kah-nay-dah"", and the voices themselves sounded entirely different. When you know what Kaneda sounds like for years, only to hear some other voice coming out of him, it's jarring.

And I'd watched it so many times that I knew all the dialog word-for-word. Like the scene in the bar where Yamagata is harassing the a drug buyer and says, ""Hey, man, that stuff'll stunt your growth!"" and the bartender gets on his case about bothering a paying customer and he says, ""Then I won't tell him what's in it, huh?""

That line is gone in the redub and I desperately wanted it back. The only solution for me has been to dig out my old VHS copy and watch that on a slowly dying VCR."

MaJuV,2018-11-08,"The story of Death Note is that no matter how noble the initial thoughts are (e.g. the killing of criminals), absolute power corrupts absolutely.

And there is no need to write under my comment ""I feel/know that if that thing would be mine, i could use it in best/nice way possible"" blah blah blah, NO, The human factor is simple, human will use goddes powers in his own needs. And these need in 90% would be his own desires.  
Even if he at start does the good thing, that everybody agrees it was good. Who knows, what he would start doing next with death note. And the question is: Will it be the same good things that he start to do at his start?"

grendus,2013-12-19,"I'd probably use it, but probably not much.

The world is full of terrible people and killing them all would be... a lot. But there are some individuals who are head and shoulders worse than the others. Putin, for example, is just a vile person who pretty much unilaterally kicked off a war of aggression, has basically wrecked Russia and done irreparable damage to Ukraine. So yeah, I'd probably put his name in the book. I wouldn't go for something painful or ironic, nobody would be surprised if he had a massive stroke in his sleep - he's old and he has to be under insane stress.

I'd probably have to establish some very strict rules about it. I don't want to start knocking off every billionaire or politician who I found particularly vile. But setting specific thresholds, like directly being responsible for a large number of deaths, would fit. I'm not looking to destabilize or reshape the world, all I want is to remove the worst of the worst to keep things moving in a positive direction. And even then, I'm not sure I trust my own judgement. You kill one parasite and another one takes his place, would destabilizing Russia really be better (ok, that one probably is true, but it's a more difficult question with something like a Cartel leader where it might kick off a gang war that would kill a lot of innocent people)."

Legacyopplsnerf,2018-10-08,"Keeping it hidden would be easy as hell.

Assuming (like in the manga/anime) Death Notes are not well known, then it's a totally untraceable method of murder. The hard bit is just preventing someone from accidently finding and touching the note (as then they would be able to see the god of death following you around all the time). So it's a bit harder if you have nosy room mates or live with family who don't respect privacy, but if you've ever had to keep stuff hidden from them in the past you already know how to get around that.

Light only got caught in the end because he let his ego get the best of him, then proceeded to play games with the police instead of staying on the downlow.

The issue most people would face is the guilt of murdering people and (more importantly) the consequences their death bring."

He's too ""creative"" and ""clever"" for his own good, L gets him down on the short list of suspects in an afternoon and he only evades capture so long because he has both people and gods acting to directly support him, including a shinigami who literally sacrifices herself to save his girlfriend (saving him in the process)

There are so many ways of making something look *not* like a Death Note kill but Light can't bring himself to not be a dramatic little bitch"
sparksen,2016-01-22,"Getting catched would be much harder in our world.

The main problem is living with yourself doing it. Light was crazy and that's how he could live with the stress of murdering so many people.

If a normal person would do this and see the unforeseen consequences and chaos of killing some dictator or evil person it would do some crazy things to your mind"
The_Atomic_Cat,2020-01-14,"If you watched the anime you'd know light wasn't actually a conniving genius, he was actually sort of a dumbass. He very easily could've been never caught, but his ego got the best of him and it made him make choices that clearly gave himself away to some extent.

Also his ideology of a 100% death penalty rate for all criminals regardless of conviction is pretty genocidal, he's practically a fascist. So he's a shitty person too. The death note could likely be used for good but he didn't do that at all and he was an egotistical genocidal maniac."
Unlikely_Tea_6979,2023-09-28,"If you used the death note to get a bunch of famous figures all on the same date and time then you wouldn't have to have lights skill for mind games because the majority of people on earth hate the majority of heads of state & far right celebrities.

Even better, start by going after like, the corrupt mayor of a major Chinese city (assuming you don't live in china).

Now there are 8 million suspects and you're not one of them."

100YearsWaiting2Shit,2020-07-01,"I feel we don't have to worry about being as smart as light cause we don't have any detectives even smarter to figure out several criminals getting heart attacks is directly the result of some vigilante and would either be viewed as some new pandemic or the wrath of God. Unless of course you have that one detective who actually saw death note and they go ""MY TIME HAS COME""


Plus I think it'd be easier to get away with it if you don't just write people's names and add a bit more detail cuz you can choose how someone ends. The heart attacks is the basic route of just writing someone's name but you can have them disappear so no one can find them if I remember correctly"

International-Cat123,2021-06-18,"To be fair, it’s never confirmed that the afterlife actually existed in that universe or that the rule is true. The rules weren’t naturally part of the Note; Ryuk wrote them. We also know that nothing prevented Light from writing down a fake rule. We all know that Ryuk is the sort of absolute shit who would have found it hilarious to watch someone who really wanted to use the Note torment themselves over that rule. Therefore, it’s reasonably possible that either the rule is outright false and humans who use a Note will still be able to go to the afterlife or the rule is technically the truth in that no one who uses a Note will go to an afterlife because no one goes to an afterlife."
MysticSnowfang,2019-06-20,I'd make that sacrifice to save thousands of lives. The Needs of the Many...

There is a reason due process is a thing, and Light never had such noble intentions."
isekaitis_victim,2020-09-07,"If you think that the killing of already convicted criminals can be called noble, then the killing of other people really won't be that big of a jump. The justification of murder lies in having no other choice when a horrible situation needs to be prevented."
GodTaoistofPatience,2020-09-24,"Counterpoint: *Death Note* is not necessarily a story about power corrupting, but about power revealing. Light Yagami doesn’t *become* a monster because of the Death Note, it simply unmasks the god complex, perfectionism, and thirst for control that were already latent in him.

From the very beginning Light shows little hesitation or moral conflict. He approaches the notebook with calculation and ambition not fear or guilt. The power doesn't twist him, but rather it allows him to act without consequence and in doing so reveals who he truly is.

So rather than saying ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" the story seems to suggest that absolute power reveals absolutely. The Death Note does not change Light. It exposes him."

So. Your only answer is to hide the fact you exist, because anyone that dies from the death note might out you, and get you killed.

Imagine every death note command tells them to out all the billionaires they know, all the protectors of billionaires they know, all the terrible people they know.

People would be pressured to not misrepresent themselves that way, not to be seen hiding a billionaire. Or they will be killed without exception just to get to the billionaire. The best way a billionaire can safeguard their own life is to kill you first."

DracTheBat178,2023-09-25,"This is why you don't use patterns, if you're going to do it, make each death different enough to where there's nothing leading back to the killer. Make the deaths believable. If you think someone would commit suicide, whether intentionally or accidentally, then have them do it. Light's problem in the anime is that he wanted to be a god, if you're going to use the death note, your ego has to be kept in check. Don't kill too much at one time, space it out, and start small. And when everything is over, get rid of it."

DragonNutKing,2025-01-13,"The thing is a pattern would only happen if you where dum. Or wanted the public to know. Not to mention the story states you can control what the people does before to a good extent. Instead of just heart attacks only. Do normal people deaths.

Exp. Fall in the shower. Car accident. Get sick and die in 24 hours. Blood clot. Gets into a fight with different targets. They end up both dead. 

Heck can write they turn over a new leaf and die later. Technically it counts and would make it happen. Light really didn't think about using to benefit society. He just killed evil/corrupt and those that would have stopped him."

pv505,2012-05-03,In the anime you could control the Target's actions to a reasonable degree. Collecting data and sending it to authorities and news agencies is definitely within the bounds. There's no reason you couldn't make them all send that data then off they go 😅

wandering-monster,2016-08-20,"That assumes they know how it works. Not gonna be easy if you're only targeting public figures.


Like, how would they know it's based on names and faces? Everyone important has a public name and face. Plus there's random famous people dying of heart attacks all the time, so that'd confound any patterns that did exist. The danger might as well be ""ate food"", ""looked at something"", or ""breathed"" at that point.


It's more likely they'd find some other more specific pattern and fixate on it (they all attended this party last year, or all traveled on a Boeing plane in the week before they died, or similar) even if it's wrong.


Especially if you were using it smart and spreading your targets around a bit. Have them die of different things (why not a stroke, poisoning, food allergy, and so on?). Also nothing says their death has to be instant. Maybe they die of undetected brain cancer over the next few weeks, or develop a deadly allergy then eat a peanut. Maybe they have a minor golf injury then die of surgical complications. No need to be in a hurry when you're fixing the world."

Remember he started there because he traced the first suspicious death to one that happened in that region and only broadcast in that region. He also had data that the killings marked the timescale of a Japanese students time schedule. 

That broadcast act was more instant confirmation and to rattle Light. L already knew Kira was in that area.

Essentially, he developed his god complex and his psychotic mass murder to make himself feel better about killing people. He doubles down again when L confronts him on live tv in the next chapter, calling Kira evil. He knows he’s evil, but he doesn’t want to face it, so to justify it further, he declares than any who try to stop him are as evil as the criminals he’s killing.

A hero to one group may be a villain to another. Is it better to just eliminate both villains judging by a specific standard? Or will this just lead to infighting amongst their group to find a suitable successor? Not to mention the kingpins of the world would not require any public presence, so just a little informational gap would mean not a regime change, but merely a puppet switch (see - the Romanian Revolution). 

As mentioned before, there will be a stronger impact/revolution if the deaths will be synchronized.  That said, not even the internet as a whole will be free from biases and lack of deep institutional knowledge of who actually influences the top faces of this world...

Wasn't that intentional by Light? As in, it wasn't so much about killing criminals as it was sending a message. ""If you do crime, then Kira will judge you.""

He wanted people to be afraid of Kira, such that people wouldn't want to break the law. And eventually, society will grow from it. If he tried to cover it up with different deaths and fewer targets, it would be more likely to go unnoticed by the public. And as such, the status quo would remain unchanged.

I do not think that would be the normal response. If you wrote a name down, you wrote it down for a reason and I assume you would want to see the (potential) positive effects from that decision. 

That would seem like a very reasonable reaction to me.

It is very easy (see the first point) but there is still this understanding of what you are doing here and the weight of this decision, especially in the beginning for the first few names.

UncreativeUser01,2020-03-13,"I don't think that'd work, because the actions have to be something the target would actually be willing to commit. 

Making them accidentally reveal things would still be fair game, though."
QJ-Rickshaw,2018-10-12,"I think how they die isn't as important as when they die. The impact can be just as strong, even if they don't all get heart attack. 

As long as they all die at the exact same time. I'd still attribute that to divine retribution.

I also just don't want the writer to get caught."

I'd go the Final Destination route to minimize casualties."
ArokLazarus,2012-12-07,Death Note can't be used to have someone kill someone else. I know it's a joke but for context of the rules I thought it would be fun to share.

QJ-Rickshaw,2018-10-12,"If every billionaire in the world all died all at once, no matter their location or circumstances. I would think that that's some sort of divine intervention, a sign that they need to be stopped.

If people step in, wait a few months, do it again. They'll catch on eventually.

Edit: Someone also made the very valid point that taking too long and doing it one by one will cause billionaires to catch on and start to hide their names from public records. Then you're fucked. 

You need to take them all down at once before anyone catches on, so that's why I'd spend a year finding all their names while they suspect nothing."
QJ-Rickshaw,2018-10-12,"So interesting thing with the death note, you can manipulate the mind of the victim before you kill them.

Like you can have them write the sentence ""death to the 1%"" on a wall, board, piece or paper etc. Just before they die and they'll be compelled to do it. Then when the body is found, the message will also be found. 

I think that would maintain the impact you want while also showing that you could die, anywhere, anyhow, that they're not safe.

Edit: Someone commented that you should have the victim call a press conference and spill all their dirt, just before they die. It's within the death note's power to do that and I think that would be so much bettet."
TheG-What,2014-06-28,"That’s exactly what happened in the series though, because Light was an egomaniacal psychopath."
QJ-Rickshaw,2018-10-12,Now we're cooking.
QJ-Rickshaw,2018-10-12,"I wasn't aware of that, but that's fine, not a huge train smash.

IridiumPoint,2014-07-09,"Self-immolation it is, then."
AwakenedSheeple,2013-05-09,"Not necessarily, though, right? 

Like I bet many of Kira's victims didn't *want* to write his name in their own blood, or suddenly jump off a roof. Or that one person who was so desperate to hunt down Kira, only to be forced by the Death Note into committing the perfect untraceable suicide. As long as the victim is capable of fulfilling the writing and no external factors prevent it, they'll do it."
QJ-Rickshaw,2018-10-12,"The Death Note is capable of compelling people to take actions they wouldn't otherwise take. You can make someone commit suicide easily. You can even tell them to do it in a way that's discreet or very public.

What you're thinking of is that the Death Note can't make someone do something that they don't personally have knowledge of.

Eg. Write Bigfoot's real name before jumping off a building. 

Or, send out the US nuclear launch codes on the internet before slitting your throat.

If the victim does not actually know these things, then it defaults to a heart attack."
IridiumPoint,2014-07-09,"I haven't watched the anime, so I don't actually know all the intricacies of the rules. However, I wouldn't be surprised if all of those people were fully willing to rat everyone else out, and are only prevented from doing so by a MAD-like scenario where they know the others have kompromat on them as well. You could therefore engineer the scenario for patient zero like this: ""A rival puts a hit on them. They learn of it beforehand and as retaliation they go public with everything they know."" And then keep going with the original plan."
Maximelene,2012-04-02,"Oh yeah sorry, I misread your ""randomize the **cause**"". My bad.

I think all of them dying in the exact same way would be more impactful though. And wouldn't really increase the chances of the writer getting caught."
Jedimaster996,2012-07-18,"I think you'd also have to spread out the individuals outside of specific political parties, countries/nationalities, etc to avoid triggering a potential war. If you're going to knock out a lot of corrupt people at the same time/within the same month, you ideally wouldn't want it to look suspicious. 

For example if you targeted all folks from one political party in one particular country, it might look like a coordinated attack from the 'opposition' even if it wasn't able to be proven. If it was all political leaders from every party in a single country, it might look like an attack from a foreign nation/entity and could trigger a war with the quickest scapegoat. But spread across all kinds of jobs/professions/peoples/nations/etc, it might look a lot closer to 'divine retribution'."

bittens,2016-03-07,"I can't remember, can the Death Note blow past precautions meant to stop the kind of death being written?

For example, if the owner writes that the target sneaks a gigantic metal battleaxe (or any other huge weapon which would be impossible to hide on their person and which could never ordinarily get past airport security) onto a plane, hijacks the plane, and crashes it into a mountain... Does the Death Note then make it so that airport security and all other staff are totally blind to the battleaxe?"

x4000,2009-07-20,"If the anime/manga of death note never existed, and private jets kept crashing in air traffic control errors, and people kept drunkenly falling off their yachts, nobody is going to think “hide my name from the press.”

Even if a bunch of people started having heart attacks in prisons, it would be a search for a novel disease, not “who was announced on the news’s lately.” Especially in the modern day, unless someone wants it to be known there is a supernatural element going on, just give it a few years before someone seems to be getting away from the law. It would also cut down on the number of mistakes made."
Maximelene,2012-04-02,"Yeah, but let's be honest, the series has a huge amount of elements created specifically so that Light would get caught, even if he still remained the same kind of egomaniacal psychopath.

DevelopmentGrand4331,2024-11-14,"Yeah, but (and forgive me if I don’t remember correctly because it’s been a while) isn’t it just that a bunch of criminals start dying of heart attacks, and based on that, people figure out that there’s someone killing them, and then L figures out that it must be someone who can kill anyone magically if that person knows their name and face?

There are some major leaps in there that wouldn’t be made in real life.  If a bunch of criminals die from heart attacks, it’d take a while before anyone suspected those were related, and then they’d spend years trying to figure out how they were all being poisoned.  they’d look for some kind of massive organization that’s able to poison criminals around the world at will.  They wouldn’t start by looking for a single person with magical abilities."
greenskye,2012-08-10,"And he targets criminals that aren't widely known enough. As long as you limit yourself to people known somewhat broadly, it's basically impossible to trace.

Combine that with some basic diligence in ensuring the deaths are more reasonable and believable and you could go decades before anyone ever even thought it might be magic killing people."

QJ-Rickshaw,2018-10-12,"So I found out that there's a rule that if you specify time of death, it has to occur within 23 days from the day you write the name. So death by old age won't work."
QJ-Rickshaw,2018-10-12,"I mean that's fine. But it sounds like it could lead to a lot of unnecessary collateral and bystander death. That's basically just starting an all out war.

Someone else suggested I just get them all to make press conferences, admit to all their wrong doings and commit ritual suicide. The Death Note is capable of that so I'd rather do that. I feel it sends the strongest message with minimal bloodshed.

I just want the rich to stop abusing the world, I'm not interested in a war or violent murder."
gerusz,2010-05-20,"Yes, but the Note didn't cause the cars to swerve towards them. It can arrange common ""accidental"" deaths even if there is someone else involved, but it can't mind control someone else into murdering for you.

ChiefCasual,2018-06-13,Yeah that's basically what I meant.
TheIlluminate1992,2019-04-12,Ooof.  That's a rough one.  I'll have to think about that.  Personally I wouldn't care who got what.  I'd just randomize the names in the script and let fate have its way.

In reality, I think a lot of people would make some REALLY obvious mistakes if given this magical power. People can be pretty obtuse and short sighted, and the governments of the world would freak and try to stop whatever is going on."
TheG-What,2014-06-28,"Not quite.     
A bunch of criminals all start dying of heart attacks in Japan. Some that have been sentenced, some awaiting trial, but more concerning is that it seems to keep happening to criminals that have their names and faces on the news. Now that’s weird.    
So L thinks “Alright, maybe this is just a bizarre coincidence but it merits investigation.” So he gets a criminal that hasn’t been announced by the police or anything to the public and has that guy appear and give his name and face on tv- but he only does it in one prefecture (equivalent to state or province) at a time.    
That’s how he figures out they’re doing it by name and face and somehow magically. And narrows down the location. It’s not really that much of a jump in logic. Sure it is a bit of a jump, but not absurd."

Fortune 500 companies have their entire C-suite on their websites for all to see. With minimal googling you could compile a comprehensive list in a few days no problem. What gets tricky, is getting the people that will inherit the wealth they leave behind, because after the first batch, the convenient lists and websites will be wiped off.

By the way, this is just a metaphorical scenario since the Death Note doesn't actually exist."
DevelopmentGrand4331,2024-11-14,"Yeah, but L does that because he suspected the killer needed to know the criminal’s name and face.

And— again, I may be remembering wrong— but I thought it wasn’t just criminals dying in Japan, but L decides to test Japan because that’s where the first death happened, or something like that."
SignalScientist2817,2021-06-26,"the thing that did light in was going only for \*japanese\* criminals. if he went international, concentrated in other countries to throw of his scent, and didn't go for L directly, now, that's a different story."

Like I said, one of the big comments above you says to just go on the internet and ask people to make a kill list for you. This is the kind of think that would happen. Someone would make a post on reddit, 4chan, whatever, and they'd be found. Another way that people get caught? They tell other people that they did it, or that they're planning to do it. Someone who basically has a magical superpower going on a power trip? They might say something that they shouldn't to their friends or family. Even if they're just going on Discord with their private server and talking anonymously to their friends who are like-minded politically. That's how many people get busted.

People don't use common sense. The government doesn't need to understand how you did it to make the assumption that you're somehow *involved* in something if they use their resources properly. You always get caught because of a mistake you made."
TheG-What,2014-06-28,"It wasn’t only happening in Japan, but that’s where it was happening most frequently. L even says that he thought the whole thing was bunk at first but came up with the plan as in “What the Hell, I guess maybe it is possible?” And he was surprised to be right.    

Anyway, not that it matters because to go back to my original point, Light *wanted* everyone to know he had the ability to kill at any time; it was the whole point of his plan. He just got narrowed down early because his ego wouldn’t let him see that he was being obvious. And also, Light is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is."

mike_2797,2017-07-31,Frieren sweeped the rankings that's to be expected top 4 no surprises either.
expandpong,2022-05-05,"Banger year, tbh. That top 10 is wacky."
Kooky-Height5945,2020-10-18,It's kinda funny seeing gushing over magical girls on this list.
nuraHx,2014-02-04,The BIG fight episode of Mushoku Tensei S2 is still one of the best team choreographed fights I’ve seen in anime. Every character had their purpose in the fight and it was all hype as hell.
SouekiSennoSTM,2024-05-31,"I'm disappointed in a way by how many older pre-2024 series there are by way of new seasons rather than more series new and specific to 2024, but I suppose that's to be expected by how many of them have larger pre-established audiences for them before the year even begins.

Only three of my own Top 10 for the year even registered (in the Top 25 chart), but I'm glad at least that two of my Top 5 made it quite close to the top (Girls Band Cry and Dungeon Meshi - I also have Dungeon Meshi at #4 placement, coincidentally).

Overall and in general though, for me personally it was a stronger year than, say, 2022, but not as strong as 2023, 2020, or 2021."
[eliminado],,Breaks my heart Sengoku Youko didnt end up on top 25 ;(
Goshawk5,2015-08-07,Yo Brave Burn made the top 25! That one was wild.
The_Dreams,2016-09-04,Dude I forgot how absolutely stacked 2024 was. We absolutely feasted on great content all year didn’t we?
Mahkeva,2020-05-11,"Very happy to see Yatagarasu on that list, even if in my totally biased opinion, it should be WAAYY higher. Also I’m surprised at Brave Bang Braver. I loved it while it was airing but didn’t think it was THAT popular."
ratherthanme,2019-01-05,The one person who put Gundam SEED Freedom as their number one is a capital-G Gigachad and I respect them. I don’t agree (I wouldn’t even put it on my top 10) but I did enjoy it very much.
grimjowjagurjack,2022-07-28,My two favourite anime of the year undead unluck and elusive samurai aren't even here 🙂
Stormy8888,2019-07-14,"I am just so happy to see Bravern in the top 25. That was the most subversive, new, different anime of 2024 for me."

K4nono,2020-08-25,"Musshoku Tensei, Re:Zero and Apothecary Diaries cracking top 10 makes me so happy"
[eliminado],,"2024 was probably the best year of anime since 2011.

  
Also, Sengoku Youko is seriously snubbed. One of the best, COMPLETE stories in anime."
Zio_Benito,2019-04-29,"Sad to see Wistoria and DanMachi so low on the list.

I can agree on the second because of the incomplete airing, but Wistoria definitely rocked hard"
Delicious_Low_,2021-06-02,Days with my stepsister should also be here
steven4869,2020-04-09,"Girls Band Cry and Dangers in my Heart in the top-10, r/anime had good taste all of a sudden. Hopefully Girls Band Cry wins something in the upcoming sub's award show."

enigma7x,2010-11-07,What a stacked fucking list holy shit.
Saekoa,2016-03-02,Surprised dandadan already was able to be second
randommd81,2021-01-10,"Super excited that Yatagarasu cracked the top 25, as well as Dead Dead, possibly two of the most overlooked shows of the last year…though maybe not quite as overlooked as I thought. 

And gonna sound edgy or whatever, but glad Solo Leveling was towards the bottom of the top 25. Solid show, but it’s the hype is definitely overblown a bit"

prock1903,2020-06-24,So happy blue box made it at #22. I know many people have not watched it but please give it a try especially manga. The way it handles the mature themes is just so good. Please give it a try as only 13 episodes have aired.
TheNinjaPir8,2016-03-18,"Yoooooo Bravern made the top 25, let's fuckin gooooooooo!!!!!!

It makes me so happy to see my top anime of the year make it on this list. I thought it wouldn't have gained this much attention and would be slept on. Glad to see my big yaoi mech anime get recognition."

Sentinel_Of_Sound,2016-01-02,"Ayy Bravern made the list! A lot of mecha these days is fine, but honestly bravern is a step above. It's got heart, it's funny, and the music is great. If I had a blu ray player, it'd be the first thing I buy as soon as it's available."
Wooden-Tourist6907,2025-01-05,I'm very happy that Frieren is the most popular one. Because it is an Anime that u can recommend to not-Anime-fans without people thinking of u as a creep or pervert
Demiz3r,2016-08-02,Yatagarasu deserves to be higher.
ReindeerKind1993,2020-11-23,"It's a shame the danmachi production team got ""nuked"" I wonder when or if it will get finished season 5"

Whole-Shape-7719,2020-11-08,"Super happy for Frieren, Appthecary and Makeine, but kinda sad about The Fable. Well, at least it did good in Japan."
BDNjunior,2021-07-29,Orb: On the Movements of the Earth deserves to be so much higher. Should be up for anime of the year in my opinion
Stunning-Donkey-5686,2021-02-05,"2024 really was stacked for shows, and 2025 is looking just as stacked, I can't wait for what's comes out this year!"
Makoto_Kurume,2023-07-22,It's Dungeon Meshi and hibike euphonium for me. I count Frieren as a 2023 anime. Maybe also gush girl as the 3rd one

Honestly higher than I probably would have expected"
ScreenWriterGuy07,2021-06-27,"Holy shit Orb made it!!!!

I can't be more happier, as it deserves all the recognition in the world. It truly is a masterpiece of a show

Somehow it managed to be favourite show in fall despite ReZero, DanDaDan and many other bangers airing in that season

On that note, I kinda didn't expect to see ReZero in the top 10, considering only one half was aired and it hasn't been that long either. I mean it was pretty great for the most part so I get it, just a little surprised."
Sixsignsofalex94,2020-01-31,"Frieren was truly a treasure

Also wow what a year!

Frieren, Kaiju no8, DanDanDan, Delicious in dungeon, solo leveling!

Along side my favourite Re:Zero aaaand Bleach season to date"
zcareface,2019-01-24,Toss a few good coins for spice and wolf. We need more seasons
DandoloFTW,2017-05-19,"Great list overall.

Sad to see my personal number 1 Kimi Ni Todoke season 3 way down at 45 but not surprising given how long the gap was since season 2 and it being released all at once on Netflix.

It's interesting to see how many sequels, 2023 continuations, and reboots made the top 25. Lines up with my feeling that this was a year with very strong returning content but not as strong in terms of new shows as the 3 prior years."
ClemFire,2016-12-07,"While Frieren and ReZero were my number 1 and 2, I have to give massive shoutouts to both Girls Band Cry and The Dangers in My Heart S2. Even if they are not your typical genre I would highly recommend checking them out."
The_Goku_Vegeta,2024-08-02,"Bleach #17 I think it should have been up

Frieren & dandadan been top 2 in list & my personal favourite as well in 2024 eagerly waiting for their season 2"
runescapeanime,2021-05-04,2024 was incredible honestly. Its also the year where I caught up on One Piece (including movies) during summer vacation and winter vacation. I did use One Pace though so that’s kinda cheating
Comprehensive_Dog651,2021-12-03,"Ones with the most karma at the top as is to be expected, but some astonishing placements for Girls Band Cry (looks like that one really blew up), Yataragatsu, Brave Bang Bravern and what is probably my personal AOTY, Dead Dead Demons. Would have liked to see Tonari no youkai san higher though, and Kinokoinu didn't even make the list..."

Happy for Dungeon Meshi, Orb a Sign of affection, The apothecary diaries, Frieren and Dandadan. Happy for Natsume's book of friends, Cherry Magic, 7th time loop and Windbreaker, Oblivion Battery, Kimi ni todoke 3, Yakuza Fiancé and Villainess  lv99 too, although many of them should be higher imo! (especially cherry Magic which is criminally too low, considering that it basically hits all the points many people in this sub say about what makes a good romance)"

Sr_Taquit0,2022-04-04,"The top 5 kinda have an idea, but from there are some good surprises! And huge W for frieren"
robertm94,2013-08-24,"No real surprises. All of my top ten are in the top thirteen, and the three that aren't are shows I just haven't watched (sound euphonium, mushoku tensei and re:zero).

It's also interesting to me that a bunch of the top shows were ones that technically aired last year (Frieren, apo diaries). Like yes they count because they were 2 cour shows, but it goes to show their relative strength I think."
Pharaoh_Misa,2015-12-10,"I guess my single vote for **Rising Impact** was so insignificant that it didn't even get counted. My husband will mourn his loss when I tell him. But, **Mecha Ude**!

PawnOfPaws,2022-08-07,"Shangri-La Frontier on Nr. 29! YAY!

But well... I *did* hope for more. However, I understand that Crunchy's bad introduction text *does* read a lot like Sword Art Online did. Which is quite the crime, the *only* thing they share is the term ""VR Gaming genre"", everything else is just a huge insult.

And yet... Games and gaming like that is still a niche genre and not as easily digestible as the average romance anime - plus, the trauma from SAO is still burning for many too. 

*Sigh*... Too bad, too bad."

BigBadBurito,2015-11-30,"Top4 is unsurprising, and deserved, but the 5-10 is not what I had expected, in a good way. Especially with GBC getting close to TOP5.

Discardofil,2021-06-06,"Honestly, I assumed a lot of these were older than they actually were.  Not counting Konosuba and other new seasons of older shows.  For some reason I thought Frieren and Solo Leveling had already been around for a few years.

It probably doesn't help that crunchyroll keeps recommending me older stuff that I had never heard of before."
Rexcodykenobi,2021-08-27,"I still need to watch most of these but Frieren, Spice & Wolf, and Delicious In Dungeon made this year a real treat for fantasy fans. Here's hoping that their season 2's all release the same year so we can do this once more."

Ocixo,2019-08-28,"The fact that Passione got to do the remake of Spice and Wolf isn’t a mere coincidence. One of their executives is Takeo Takahashi, who directed the original anime series and returned as the director for this remake."
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,"On that topic, the most common start to a ballot was Frieren first and Apothecary second."
Falsus,2013-06-27,"Airing at the same time season as Frieren probably made it the 2# show for a lot of people, like being stuck in it's shadow. 

It was my 1# show though, and I am so excited for Friday for the second season."
Radi-kale,2022-02-12,Too much overlap between Frieren fans I presume
CosmicPenguin_OV103,2018-07-24,"To me it's a rock solid all-rounded ""A- performance"" for season 1, but I am still waiting for either a really intriguing detective case for Maomao, or some kind of emotional moments to happen \[Season 1\]>!Maomao's parents' history was pretty close to be it, but just missed as becoming that spark for me!<. Hopefully I can see that in the upcoming season!"
Smoke_Santa,2020-08-02,"up against Frieren and DunMesh, Dandadan also aired recently. I think Frieren and Apothecary fandom overlaps a lot, and Frieren is deemed to be the better show, so its definitely people picking Frieren #1 then Apothecary #2 or #3"
Anhanger10,2024-11-10,"I feel like DanDaDan has more of a recency bias, otherwise Apothecary  Diaries could have been second."
Fools_Requiem,2016-06-12,"IMO, Frieren might be the best anime of the decade.   It's that good."
KingdomOfZeal,2023-08-25,"I went into Frieren ready to roast it for being overrated. I thought it's ranking was must've been way too high. By the end of the season, I was blown away. It's simply phenomenal."
Late-Struggle4070,2024-09-16,"Why? It’s not that good. Dungeon Meshi is way better, in my opinion."
Illustrious-Fox5135,2022-10-13,In the meantime can we also appreciate the banner choice for Frieren? Easily her worst enemy lol
CosmicPenguin_OV103,2018-07-24,Yeah considering we didn't even have a legal streaming option till November it's sensational performance. And the 3 ones having more gold counts than it are the trio that made me feel great again on watching fantasy themed anime so it's all good!
Illustrious-Fox5135,2022-10-13,Most surprising anime of 2024 for me personally and plot developments that no one saw coming as well.
daffy_duck233,2015-04-06,"Yeah totally agree, what's even more surprising to me is that I don't see Shangri-la Frontier on this list, given how much people here seemed to like it."
Frostbitten_Moose,2017-07-31,"I mean, Bravern made it.  This format seems to be ideal for shows with the hyper dedicated fans who can remember what they even watched this year (for example, I didn't vote because I couldn't remember shit like ""What year did Bravern show in?"")"
FelixAndCo,2017-10-03,Also *Look Back* is a welcome surprise. Thought a movie would have a harder time getting votes.
TJRex01,2017-05-27,"I was really surprised to see Bravern here. It’s like “what if a super robot series wandered into a real robot series, and also really gay.” I loved it but thought it was doomed to be super niche."
CosmicPenguin_OV103,2018-07-24,"I really really need to take time watching the first two ASAP, hopefully around February after I clear out some old anime already in queue. And Bravern was certainly really funny till the end!"
dododomo,2016-02-23,"I was happy that bravern even made it into top 50, let alone top 25!

####BRAVERN!!!"
Illustrious-Fox5135,2022-10-13,Orb as well !!! Such a high ranking too 💪
MeMecurseyou,2021-05-09,"Girls Band Cry aside, all the shows above it had more karma, if anything, i'm surprised it made it above Re:Zero, MT and Konosuba."
Breakdown007,2016-06-01,"many people don't give it a chance even if everyone who's watched the show tells them how good it is. I still see ""I'm surprised how good the dangers in my heart is"" threads almost weekly"
Magic1998,2016-06-29,"It's still a winter show, those always struggle for these kinds of awards. Frieren, Maomao and Dungeon Meshi are just build different 

(I need to watch Dangers finally)"
throwaway_0721,2016-07-03,Recency bias + not on cr I assume
GlitterDoomsday,2021-03-29,"I'm surprised Kaiju barely made it, but tbf there's some stuff I forgot aired last year... 2024 was stacked."
GinsuFe,2014-04-04,"Considering the list, it deserves #1 over any other show up there."
adamsworstnightmare,2012-02-27,It was never going to be super popular but I'm glad that Bravern got some recognition. It was genuinely the most fun I've had watching anime in a long time.
dododomo,2016-02-23,"I was already psychologically prepared to see it out of top 50, but it actually made it into the top 25!!!

Plus it's really popular in Japan and winning awards too (it ranked 1st on animefestival 100 best anime of 2024 survey and won the award at Tokyo anime award festival 2024. Now it's currently 3rd on the the anime fan award survey that includes shows between October 2022-September 2024)"
[eliminado],,Not having the climax (and the better part) of the arc not adapted and still making to T10 is insane tbh.
evenstar40,2012-05-12,"Same, I often say to my husband how lucky we are to be alive during a time of such incredible anime. Classics (80s/90s) will always have a special place in my heart but modern anime is just so beautifully done these days."
maybachsonbachs,2012-01-13,I'm saving my re-watch for s2 premiere
Illustrious-Fox5135,2022-10-13,Gushing in the top 25. r/anime has truly PEAKED
steven4869,2020-04-09,"Frieren one was the most expected one, I guess it even became the r/anime's favorite anime with a quite a bit margin."
Ham_PhD,2018-05-15,Any hope of a competitive AOTY contest seems to be squashed lol
avboden,2011-12-09,See what I really like about that series is it gives cool character developbubububububbu bubububububbuububub
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,It was going to be on the chart until a couple late Bravern votes ended that run. I was devastated.
Fallen-D,2023-05-01,"I really really liked Train to the end of the world till episode 6. The writing in episode 6 was really great but after that, it lost its quality. 

Before, it had that suspense, tension and that thrill of exploring the unknown world but from episode 7 it went the comedy parody route. All the tension and suspense disappeared. It felt like a different anime. 

It was 9/10 show for me but latter half disappointed me."
Dazzling_Bobcat5172,2023-12-06,Don't heard of that but I'm gonna check it out
JVmight14,2015-12-10,Same! I loved the show so much! The characters were so great!
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,"I feel like not counting continuations but counting follow-up seasons would be an odd choice, but maybe I'm the weirdo."
Ham_PhD,2018-05-15,Outperforming a show like Konosuba is a huge win for me. I hope people's memory of this great show continues!
anhtt_,2015-04-22,"Ranked 6th in number of 1st place votes! Not sure how many people watched it, but looking at MAL it has fewer members than almost every show here except DDDD and BBB. I'm too a happy guy."
Ill_Drag,2020-04-05,Season 3 was genuinely amazing
casualgamerTX55,2021-11-12,I miss Hibike! I will likely rewatch it from time to time.
TermEnvironmental812,2020-07-20,"I love Hibike, but to be honest, having more 1st place than newer animes with more fans like Oshi No Ko, Re Zero and Mushoku really surprised me"
Nomar_95,2017-08-19,"> did not get the love it deserves due to lack of marketing from the steaming sites!

also shitty subs. It took an unreasonable amount of time to fix it, and it was already too late by the time they did."
COMPLETEWASUK,2013-03-20,All seven of us that watched it had a good time though.
Freakjob_003,2023-07-24,"DeDeDeDe and Yatagarasu in the top 25 is a huge redemption for the year. Both excellent shows that got plenty of love from their dedicated fans during their runs, but which were otherwise way under the radar. Hope this gets more eyes on them!

Plus, Orb at 14, which might've been expected to be a niche show? And Gushing over Magical Girls? Well done, folks.

Train to the End of the World just missing out at 26 though, damn."
[eliminado],,Huge agree - finished it yesterday - animation style is refreshing and the story follows so many interesting subplots - not AT ALL what I expected
CrashmanX,2012-08-30,"I honestly think DeDeDe's ending really hurt it. It felt so rushed and just kinda ""OK its fixed""."
Diligent_Case3507,2024-09-14,Cant wait for season 2 later today omg
HolidaySpiriter,2022-12-27,"It's better than Solo Leveling, but people love Solo Leveling for some reason over it."
vox35,2009-11-15,"I watched most of season 1 before I dropped it, and while I think it has a lot of great qualities, I don't understand why so many people rave about it. There are no stakes at all, except the MC's pride, I guess, so for me there is no real tension. Why should I care whether or not he does well playing his video game? 

Not complaining about you liking what you like, but for me, unless it's a comedy or something, what the characters do has to matter or I'm just not interested."
grimjowjagurjack,2022-07-28,"At least its more popular than undead unluck and elusive samurai which my favourite shows of the year 

Also a train to the end of the world was fun"
Haruka_Kazuta,2020-02-06,It's a nice mix of action and comedy.
Pharaoh_Misa,2015-12-10,Love Shangri La! The Wethermon the Tomb Guard arc spoke to me on so many levels as a gamer that it's officially my favorite arc.
Een_man_met_voornaam,2017-03-28,"Acro Trip was really fun. My week was not complete without Chroma shouting ""Date Chizuko"""
michhoffman,2016-06-05,It did get the Fall recency bias boost.  On the other hand it's kind of crazy how we got 3 Winter shows in the top 4 and 4 in the top 8.
Nihilus88,2016-08-18,The anime adaptation is not that popular. It was an amazing season though. I loved it as well
daffy_duck233,2015-04-06,"It's super well-deserved. I don't usually re-watch romcom, but Makeine? I'm obsessed about it. I personally rank it higher than both Frieren and MaoMao.

*cue episode 8 cold open*"
casualgamerTX55,2021-11-12,Best ecchi anime in very long while.
2-time-all-valley,,If only chained soldier got the same budget/love
[eliminado],,"I loved it despite seeing ep 0 first. It set me the expectations from how daily kid things move into apocalypse territory. I doubt I would have stuck to it otherwise. However the finale ruined the show for me as the set expectations was fake-ish. 

Now if you skipped ep 0 and only liked the show for CGDCT then the finale is very fine."
just_here_4_anime,2023-06-11,Someone mentioned skipping ep 0 on reddit before we started watching.  Thank god.  That would have completely ruined it!
CrashmanX,2012-08-30,"Watched EP0 first, it made things WAY more interesting. Wondering how things got to be the way they are and seeing characters show up was a lot more interesting. 

Sadly the ending felt so very rushed and flat."
Dodo_Galaxy,2022-04-14,Definitely agree.
Pollsmor,2015-08-26,Multiple 4 year gaps be like.
Nebresto,2015-03-24,"Recency bias finally starting to kick in? No matter the show, sequels always get less viewers than the first seasons. Re:Zero S1 was 9 years ago, compated to 4 years on Mushoku. That's a lot of time to drop viewers"
AmethystItalian,2013-10-04,Surprised to see both it and MT so low honestly
oops_i_made_a_typi,2012-12-22,"I think we just need more of Re:0 S3, it's still in the setup phase. It's basically the equiv of MT S2 Part 1."
funny_username69,2018-12-28,"It’s a set up arc of 8 episodes, I’m surprised it got as high as it did, even if it was my #2 behind Frieren"
_Pyxyty,2024-01-06,"I think Re:Zero is one of those shows where you either really like it or you don't care for it much, as evident with how it has more 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place votes than Mushoku yet given Mushoku ranked higher, it probably didn't appear much in 4th and below.

Though I thought of MT in the same way, so I am still surprised it's higher."
SgtRohn,2019-09-16,"With both anime's protagonist's seiyuus getting married, and both of them also always competing places in rankings, I hope their fanbases can finally be civil to each other (they won't).

Meanwhile, Konosuba is always trailing behind both of them like how the r/anime's favorite isekai poll went lol. I hope we get a Season 4 sooner rather than later."
mythriz,2013-09-10,"I actually thought it was fitting that these two shows scored around the same, since I thought many of these shows' fans are fans of both shows?

Are there actually many fans who love one of these shows and hate the other?"
maxdragonxiii,2013-06-25,"likely because it was a half season airing this year, on top of years long gaps between seasons."
Various_Length_4905,2021-02-21,4 year gaps can reduce the hype of any franchise no matter how popular and beloved it is.
Calenmir,2017-02-13,"I like Re:Zero a lot but the latest seasons aired episodes left an unfinished taste to me. 

Even though all the episodes were great they weren't better than the complete taste of all the top shows in this list for me due to plot not moving that much with the limited amount of episodes."
SinbadVetra,2024-04-25,They probably stopped caring about voting on this sub since it means nothing. Idk
Suffaru,2016-06-05,Well It might've beat Mushoku if all the planned episodes aired and it didn't go on break. Again though it's has 4 year gaps between seasons and currently on it's third season so their of course would have been drops in performance.
CosmicPenguin_OV103,2018-07-24,8 episodes isn't quite enough to seal the current arc as a Top 25 IMHO; I *think* it will get in this year if the number of excellent anime is like the last few.
daffy_duck233,2015-04-06,"I feel that this arc of Re:Zero is pretty weak compared to the previous arcs (especially compared to the Echidna one). The tension is there, but it's a different kind of tension. I think it lacks two things: the first is the mystery and suspense that kept me on edge from the past arcs, and the second are brief moments of respite in between moments of suspense. I absolutely loved the first episode (or was it the special episode when Wrath was introduced?), but unfortunately it was all downhill from there.

Mushoku Tensei is still consistent with its delivery compared to previous seasons, so no surprise here for me that it would rank higher."
nafissyed,2019-02-26,"For what was ‘weakest’ cour of S3, it will come back strong next cour, which is where the true meat of arc 5 will be at. Also, the anime has yet to cover arguably the best part of Re:0 (Arc 6), so when that part comes, I have full confidence that Re:0 will be doing numbers."
iHateThisApp9868,2024-07-12,"I still loved the adaptation, and Banshou-ou had an amazing design. Let people sleep on Mizukami Satoshi for a bit longer.

They'll love it the moment spirit circle gets a White Fox adaptation... Then I'll die happy."
Vyshe_,2020-05-06,"(I mean, since you asked..) Yeah, you should, it's great!"
ratherthanme,2019-01-05,Yes you should.
The_Norman17,2021-06-28,I'm not normally one for music anime but it's definitely a very good anime and despite being in 3d they actually make work exceedingly well which makes it so much better.
PsychoGeek,2015-03-07,"It did well by movie standards, still beat Haikyuu. This sub just sucks when it comes to films."
Zefeh,2012-06-16,It finally got a license contract signed in November to stream on Crunchyroll. It is also a Toei produced show and they have historically had iffy relations on contracting there stuff overseas but I think they might have realized their mistake after it got a huge following and they probably missed out a metric buttload on overseas $.
committed_to_the_bit,2024-07-07,"I mean, the visuals are phenomenal, the characters are all a lot of fun, the emotion hits like a truck, it's legitimately funny, the OST is amazing, the premise is pretty fresh and weird, I could keep listing things but you get the idea. if you don't vibe with it you don't vibe with it, but it has a lot going for it or it wouldn't have become the absolute smash hit it managed to be"
The_frost__,2018-01-22,"I completely agree with you, though make sure to vote that episode in the superlatives nominations if you haven’t"
Shimmering-Sky,2017-10-20,It's #1 in our hearts.
Katlima,2013-08-09,">Also I’m surprised at Brave Bang Braver. I loved it while it was airing but didn’t think it was THAT popular

It isn't that popular. It's that good and that unique."
Shimmering-Sky,2017-10-20,"> Also, Sengoku Youko is seriously snubbed. One of the best, COMPLETE stories in anime.

It *did* take second place in the bonus Love-Like ranking Fetch did, where he calculated how often a show got first through third place votes vs. fourth through tenth place votes of the people who voted for a particular anime, so that's neat at least. ~~A shame we couldn't cut the vote short after the first five votes and Sengoku Youko was winning. /s~~"
evenstar40,2012-05-12,"DanMachi surprised the hell out of me. I think a lot of people dropped it after how mediocre S2 was, S3 was a bit of a slow start (even though it gets much better) and barely anyone stuck around for the masterpiece that is S4. Hopefully it gets more attention once S5 comes back from hiatus. :/"
slicer4ever,2013-04-26,"I feel like Danmachi lost a lot of people in s2, so the show has an uphill battle every year attracting new viewers."
Pharaoh_Misa,2015-12-10,"I loved Wistoria! I thought it was on the basic side (like a I've *seen* this before kinda way), but I really loved how it was done. I see great potential in it and I'm excited for more. But, I do remember a lot of the threads in summer and a lot of people were dropping it. 😢🥺 So with all the threads and comments I saw of people hating it, even making the list is a blessing."
maxdragonxiii,2013-06-25,"it didn't help Wistoria that Mashle aired the season before, and have similar concepts but with comedy."
Aggravating-Elk-7409,2024-01-04,Have you not been on this sub before? Those shows are constantly mentioned especially the dangers in my heart
Ok-Cod5254,2020-09-19,It's #33 on full list so not too far off
DoveWhiteblood,2020-12-07,On the Full Results sheet Daima was 62nd.
TheLimburgian,2017-12-08,The last four episodes will be broadcast in the spring.
evenstar40,2012-05-12,"There are dozens of 7th time loop fans, DOZENS! Joking aside, 2024 was insane as hell for good anime so it's really, really hard to beat this year's top 25."
EyeDeeAh_42,2022-06-25,I'm fucking stoked to see Orb in top 15. I'm glad that those of us who appreciated it got the word around for others to watch it.
Minimum_Ad_6040,2024-10-14,Noice
darryledw,2014-12-09,"don't worry - season 2 is on the way, I pray that we get at least 4-5 seasons in total to have a full adaptation of Vol. 1-17....but anime Gods can be cruel."
default073,2015-06-01,Bleach fans are bad at voting anything. The only thing that exists for us is anime corner lol.
JBloodthorn,2013-11-25,"One Pace is fine, even super fans hate most of the filler."
xzzane,2014-05-20,"I think the message really resonates with older anime viewers. 10+ years ago I would have thought of Frieren as ""good but nothing incredible."" Now, it stands as my favorite anime of all time. The themes of connection and the meaning of relationships hits hard as I think of old friends I haven't spoken to in years or are no longer with me."
Ok-Cod5254,2020-09-19,"The 1st 4 episodes itself set up the main plot of the journey, hence why it aired at once for premiere. So has more of a directional flow after that."
A-Reclusive-Whale,2017-11-27,"I think Frieren is really good, but it wasn't my anime of the year. Hell, it wasn't even my favorite ""Elf mage grappling with the fact that she will outlive all her friends"" show of the Winter 2024 season.

There are lots of things to praise about the show, but I think it doesn't really capitalize on a lot of its ideas and concepts, and the overall structure feels kind of meandering (not in a good way, in a ""not entirely sure what it wants to be"" way). I think its runaway popularity is largely carried by it's amazing production value and the fact that it's the first show of its kind that a lot of people have seen."
evenstar40,2012-05-12,"Yes it really is that good. It appeals to so many age groups and types of fans, hence why it's considered one of the best anime of all time. If you're an older anime fan it hits especially hard."
SouekiSennoSTM,2024-05-31,But predictable and basically inevitable.
[eliminado],,[removed]
supermigu-,2024-06-08,1-6 are all first seasons I'm guessing that tends to be a trend for the top.
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,Glorious scene.
U_n_d_e_r_s_c_o_rr,2020-06-29,"The old guy hasn't appeared yet but the panda is indeed there. There's only 12 episodes so far but as someone who does not the original 90's show I'd say it's really enjoyable, you should definitely check it out"
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,We're still trying to invent a way to explain it. We thought putting a paragraph at the top would do the job but it never quite seems to work.
I_Cognito,2020-09-30,"The medals only show you the votes of the people who placed it as their first, second and third choice. So Re:Zero got more votes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd while Mushoku Tensei got more votes in the 4th to 10th slots."
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,"If you only count the points from the #1 and #2 votes it received, it still wins. If you get rid of the #2 votes it comes in second."
Swaghoven,2019-08-12,"My condolences.

What I like about Dandadan - characters, chemistry between main duo, crazy action and humour, story telling"
Constant_Physics8504,2021-01-20,"I saw it and agree, I actually thought it was pretty mid, I think it’s more of a childish vibe which I’m just not a fan of."
crazy_leader22,2022-09-28,"Not really, The hype is deserved"
Curebob,2022-04-20,"Meh, I think if you don't care about video games the premise of Shangri-la isn't going to be interesting enough to pick it up. I know I never bothered picking it up because I really don't care about the premise. Dude being good at video games doesn't really spark interest tbh."
supermigu-,2024-06-08,"They are both rom-coms but that's about as far as the similarities go, besides that Makeine had more karma week to week anyways."
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,"That's pretty typical. Hell, Frieren and Bocchi the last two years came first on similar situations."
Falsus,2013-06-27,"I wonder if we will have a season like Frieren Fridays to Maomao Saturdays again, that shit was insane."
Izzynewt,2016-12-05,What's SLF?
ThermonuclearPasta,2023-02-21,"That little stretch of time when we had Frieren, Apothecary Diaries and Dungeon Meshi at the same time was heaven, I don't think we will ever reach those heights ever again"
thetruegmon,2011-10-18,"Kaiju, SLF, and Solo Leveling were my top 3."
daffy_duck233,2015-04-06,Not to mention that Makeine and Dungeon Meshi are on par with those two.
slicer4ever,2013-04-26,I only feel like summer was a weak lineup this year tbh.
2-time-all-valley,,Too much isekai imo but there was quite a lot of awesome stuff
JustAMelfriend,2021-04-17,"It was a weak year if you compare it to 2021-2023. Those years were just stacked. We, fans, were spoiled with choices."
chocological,2013-03-18,Sad that it’s on hiatus on such a cliffhanger
iHateThisApp9868,2024-07-12,No fucking way??!! How come that didn't make my feed?
ShiRonium,2018-04-25,"which is exactly what I would've done if I voted

anyone else who put or would've put dangers in my heart at #3?"
Nachtwandler_FS,2016-01-02,For me it was the opposite. But I am not a majority here.
Ebo87,2014-08-16,"Funny enough season 2 of that will air in Frieren's slot , that's why it was moved from Saturday. Since both shows have similar production committees, Toho plus NTV, it was a no-brainer for NTV and Toho to push Maomao into Frieren's TV slot in Japan. And it really was FRIEREN'S spot, lol, as that special anime programing spot was created specifically for Frieren back in October 2023 on NTV.

So fans can say Frieren is letting Maomao borrow her spot, keep it warm until she returns sometime in 2026."
waterflare2805,2020-12-20,Wait season 2 is this Friday let's go
kazuyaminegishi,2013-06-28,"I feel like the plotline in your spoiler was being broadcasted as a completely different kind of story than it ended up being.


I think if they stuck the landing on that plot line it would have been an easy S+ for me but that miss really brought down the ending. Similar to Ranking of Kings for me, the entire show is S+ up to the ending where some bizarre choices really hamper it."
Discardofil,2021-06-06,"It's so good that I didn't realize how the entire plot changed halfway through (it went from a ""two towns an episode"" road show to a ""magic school tests with all new characters"" show) until a couple weeks later.  It flowed naturally into each itself and was very well written, and only after it's all ""...did we really just spend half the season on getting a certification?"""
chocological,2013-03-18,The anime adaptation is even better than the manga imo. The pacing is way better.
spacegrab,2011-01-25,"Agree, OPM (s1) is probably my favorite but Frieren wins as best overall imo. Frieren was just on another level of world setting, music, vibe, etc as far as more serious animes go. I can't remember the last time I watched something this epic (LOTR movies?)"

I had to take to the 7 seas to watch it and it was 100% worth it. I paid for it by buying a few of the CD releases & a blu-ray when I visited in Japan because it was so good and I always want to contribute to good anime series in some way with my wallet."

I'ma glaze GBC a bit in this regard. All the other shows around it had 3-4x more karma and comments in their episode discussions(including Dangers). The November release might have helped a little in that regard but considering how much smaller the viewer base was, Girls Band Cry fucking slayed here.

jasta85,2014-01-26,Solo Leveling had a large existing fanbase before the anime.  It was a popular web novel that got turned into a manhwa with fantastic art that got additional fans so providing the anime wasn't a garbage fire it was going to do well.
Zio_Benito,2019-04-29,"I don't know why but I didn't like at all the setting of just a dude playing a game , also too much comedy and overall I just couldn't get hooked to it

kazuyaminegishi,2013-06-28,"> I don't understand why so many people rave about it. There are no stakes at all, except the MC's pride, I guess, so for me there is no real tension.


Why is it hard to understand that some people don't need the characters to perma die to feel tension of them trying to accomplish their goals.


Like Hajime no Ippo has stakes even tho most fights in that manga do not carry a risk of death. Blue Lock has extremely fake stakes and is extremely popular. I mean pretty much every sports anime has similarly fake stakes and they're all very popular.


Seeing a character strive to overcome something is fun and interesting. I dont think it need be more complicated than that."
Agreeable_Nerve_8754,2024-06-05,"Even though it’s a normal non death game anime it’s hard for me to understand how people think theres not enough tension, such as  during the Wethermon fight for instance. That was great. I feel like it does a fine job building that through in game stakes that it doesn’t need to be SAO or something. It’s cool to see Sunraku win idk I don’t personally need more than that"
yohoniggha,,Tbh are there even stakes in Solo leveling ? We know it's just an overpowered mc fighting fodders and only in the end will he get a strong opponent and then too he will obviously win what even are the stakes ? It's weird people think a fantasy story with OP mc who beats everyone has stakes. Also I have read Solo leveling so I know what I am talking about. Slf on the other hand is great cause atleast there are those who can beat the MC or match him in his skills continuously
2-time-all-valley,,I mean I play dark souls knowing there’s no consequences yet still have crazy amount of fun playing with friends and making new characters. Not everything needs life and death stakes (solo leveling is known for the Mc being so utterly broken that no one in the verse stands a chance)

slippygushbeast,2017-07-09,"That's a fair and valid take, but I disagree.

While I agree it lends each story reveal a pinch of dramatic irony, episode 0 did not make me hopeful for the rest of the series. Its pacing and handling of action sequences were really poor, in my opinion, and made me hesitant to click episode 1. Episode 1, however, reeled me in like no other.

I think anyone's feelings of the ending are going to vary heavily depending on taste. I thought the ending was exactly what it needed to be, but I can see it being disappointing to some.

While I feel strongly that episode 0 doesn't leave a good impression, I suppose I shouldn't just entirely dismiss watching it first."
PsychoGeek,2015-03-07,"It's not that. Re:Zero's still huge on karma on this sub, I'm pretty sure it was the third biggest show of the year here after Dandadan and Frieren, it just didnt translate to votes in this poll. 

Hibike Euphonium threads had like a fifth of the upvotes, hasn't aired a TV season since 2016, and at one point was feared cancelled, and it still has almost as many points as Re:Zero in this poll."
JHMfield,2024-12-13,"> No matter the show, sequels always get less viewers than the first seasons.

There are too many examples of the opposite being true, for that to be the main reason. 

I think there are simply a lot more competition in the genre/niche, and so the show doesn't feel AS unique and special any more. It's still really good, but people's attention has been a bit more divided I guess."
APRengar,2012-11-26,"Not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but 8 episodes is a really low amount of episodes. 

Hell, I wish more shows did double cours over single. They leave a much larger impression when you just get more of the show together.

People argue that shows like Chainsaw Man, or 100 Girlfriends, would've done much better if we got a taste of the crazier Season 2 content.

And as much as some people didn't like the second cour of Frieren. If they had split the cour and had an entire season of just the second half, people would've been much more disappointed. Putting the second half with the first absolutely lessened that issue.

Lot of double cour shows on this list also.

What's really stupid is the people shitting on these (by objective metrics) great anime because everyone is gushing about them while they didn't like them. Get over it.

mathchem_,2016-09-12,"Hi, I advise watching at least the first four episodes in one go, as they were technically aired together as 1 episode on TV. Frieren is a slow starter if you just watch the first episode.



A lot of people dislike Frieren because it's a laid back story. It has action scenes that can stand up to JJK, OPM and Demon Slayer yet it isn't centred around fighting. What Frieren brings is the best hand-drawn animation out there, amazing orchestral music accompanying it and an amazing world, characters and story."

If you've ever invested that much time into a game only to get wrecked on a boss, it feels more compelling."
vox35,2009-11-15,"The action is really well executed, and I can see that if you weren't always thinking about the fact that the MC is playing a game, it could be really exciting. I can't seem to forget that he's just playing a game though, so it just doesn't work for me, I guess. So I get that there is tension for the MC, and within the context of the game there is tension, but since I don't really care if he wins or loses his game, I don't find that kind of tension compelling."
mrducky80,2023-08-12,"I was reading the manhwa and even finished the light novel before the anime aired. I always warn everyone that the MC is as interesting as he will ever get in the first episode, the second the powers come online he becomes bland as shit unstoppable and over powered and you should **still** read the manhwa because goddamn the art is amazing. I regret reading the light novel, nothing of value was gained from it.

It is very... mediocre as far as stories go, its like by the book generic power fantasy protag. The hype 100% is backed by the fantastic art in the manhwa but its not even close to being the best manhwa out there that should be adapted to anime (omniscient readers viewpoint would be far more fun, entertaining and most important: interesting) and I havent even dipped my toes into the romance manhwas because idgaf about the romance shit. Im positive they have better stories to tell and better character writing.

The point being that SL has very mediocre character writing and story beats. Shangri-La's character development and writing in general is far more interesting. At the very least the MC interacts with the world rather than just simply trivializing and dominating it. There is back and forth, there are other characters (and dont tell me the chick counts in SL, she has like near zero development)"

It has so much momentum and Rudy not only develops so much as a character, he literally develops his life. He went from a NEET to having a full family and tons of friends, and a career. That’s very powerful and in terms of isekai untouchable in the “earned rewards” category."

I don't dislike fantasy, though far too often it's coupled with isekai and its boring repetitive tropes and the synopsis of Shangri-la doesn't give any reason to expect more from it, other than even lower stakes because it's just a video game in-universe that (I'm assuming) he can just restart or turn off or respawn or whatever."

And as another aside, for those maybe wondering how Frieren got such preferential treatment from Japan's first commercial TV station (and still the most watched in the region they operate in), it's really simple, NTV is the parent company of Madhouse, the studio that animated Frieren. That's why when so many were doom-posting about how Madhouse were not likely coming back because they *don't make sequel* (which is utter nonsense that became fact when some people got mad they dropped One Punch Man after S1), I was smirking in the corner, as if NTV would ever let them drop Frieren, lol."

oops_i_made_a_typi,2012-12-22,"its really an anime for gamers, and gamers understand that winning or losing a game is all the stakes that we need. it's just like a sports anime really"
Psyduckisnotaduck,2015-03-26,"maybe I'm talking out of my ass, but I feel like manwha in general has overall worse storytelling fundamentals than manga. There's a much lower barrier to entry. tons of popular Korean web novels with very little editing/oversight get manwha adaptations, and the established fanbase wouldn't tolerate the author trying to improve the narrative. 

if you want a recommendation for a manwha outside of what you would normally read, I recommend Surviving Romance. despite having 'romance' in the title, it's NOT a romance, it's a suspense/horror survival story within the context of a character being transported into a high school romance novel, and then...things go Wrong. very, very wrong. 

The best manwha I've read with a romance tag is Concubine Walkthrough, which is also a 'trapped in a VR game' narrative. It's also probably the best sci-fi manga I've read, but to really understand why you have to get pretty deep into it."
Firewolf06,2018-05-15,in re:zero's memory snow ova they literally cut to a scene from konosuba too lol
cenesthesie,2025-01-08,"You're right. For someone like me who isn't a gamer, Shangri-La felt like a video game tournament. I love fantasy and was intrigued by the lore, but I dropped it around ep12 for a few reasons.

First, I don't play games where you level up or fight to win, so I couldn't relate to the MC's motivations. I respect people who enjoy that, but I cannot connect with a MC who has these kinds of expectations of a video game.

Second, the pacing was awful. I can tolerate slow pacing if I’m immersed but here they sometimes made everything feel dragged out.

Third, the ability to log off ruined the stakes. If the fantasy world isn’t real, then there’s no tension.  MC's worse mistakes will only result in a mildly infuriating moment in his life which is equivalent to a drop in the ocean of his life experiences. It’s like Frodo saying, “I’m logging out; I’ve got an exam tomorrow.” Not a fan of role-play.

Finally, the romance subplot made it worse. Using the game to get close to a crush made the fantasy world feel like a tool rather than a meaningful setting. If the guy were to love cooking, the anime would've been under the ""Gourmet"" tag. For a romance anime it's fine. For a fantasy, not all.

In the end, Shangri-La felt like a story about a dude playing video games. Not appealing for me."
[eliminado],,"It begins to air on my birthday, I'm hype"
HeavyBlues,2019-08-18,"Seconding the recommendation. You know how SAO was an anime about an MMO written by someone who has very clearly never played one?

SLF is the opposite. It speaks gamer as its first language."
nybbas,2011-06-22,"I'll second the op. Bird thing looked like to me. Started watching it with my kid. Glad I waited because it was amazing and I had a bunch of episodes to binge 🤣🤣

It's really good"
JHMfield,2024-12-13,"I'll add a counter-weight argument as someone who did not particularly enjoy SLF.

My biggest gripe with the entire show is the fact that there's nothing on the line. There's no story of saving the world, or anything like that. It's literally about some dude playing a video game just for fun. There's nobody forcing him to play, there is no failing at it either, not really. You lose nothing by dying in game, you can instead just respawn and try again until you succeed. Which he does. Over and over again. He gets into a fight, and dies 50 times in a row until he finally gets it right.

To me, that took a lot of fun out of it. Yes, it's a pretty faithful anime adaptation of what being an MMO nerd is all about, but to me, it just doesn't work.

Comparing it to the likes of SAO or Log Horizon or other similar shows really highlights how meaningless everything the main character does, is. I may as well open up a Twitch stream of someone playing an MMO and that's about as exciting as that anime."
Frostbitten_Moose,2017-07-31,I've also had things which I know I would hate because they were simply overhyped.  But I generally try and avoid them until enough time has passed that I feel I can give them a fair shake.  Can't imagine going into them ready and expecting to be let down.
Martel732,2010-08-29,"Eh, that is kind of unavoidable with anime. There are so many shows that only adapt part of a manga or adapts a manga that is still releasing new volumes. If only reviewed anime that was the complete story there would be many extremely popular anime that wouldn't meet the criteria. I think it is reasonable for someone to say that the currently released episodes of ""Frieren"" are the best they have ever seen. And then the ratings can change if future seasons end up being worse."

eggstacy,2010-09-26,"the contrast between the 2 replies sums it up. SAO was utterly stupid nonsense that turned people off because it was overdramatic with the ""this video game puts everything on the line"" garbage ""oh no if i don't beat this candy crush level the entire universe is going to explode!"" and SLF is about just enjoying gaming, it's like if LetMeSoloHer was the MC of an anime."
YouButHornier,2018-10-03,"There is an overarching plot thats actually about the games lore, though its not the mcs focus as he doesnt care too much about the story"
Psyduckisnotaduck,2015-03-26,"Well, I mean, it's kind of geared towards people that already watch people playing games on Twitch/Youtube but it's like a scripted, dramatized version of that. Yeah, there's no stakes, but it doesn't really pretend there are any. it's a 'fucking around' show, and I don't fault anyone for bouncing off it. But realistically a lot of series have 'fake stakes' because you know the characters have plot armor and their goals are kind of arbitrary. SLF doesn't bullshit you about it. 

it's not actually comparable to SAO or Log Horizon, but mostly to Bofuri as well as low stakes competition type shows. it's kind of just slice of life with action scenes. the VRMMO element makes it tempting to compare it to SAO, but the series have very different ambitions.

Why does there even have to be a story about saving the world all the time? the lack of serious stakes makes SLF a comfort show. I get to enjoy great action scenes without the attached stress of worrying if characters without plot armor will get injured/die."

Don't get me wrong, I love RWBY even with all its short comings but they literally forced the blake and yang relationship, blake had a good thing with sun, and yang is more of a wild card, I don't think she would like to be held down with a relationship, but a Sunday day night with a bottle of (insert alcohol here) oh most certainly."

Even the AI's fall is rushed as hell, when it's supposed to be really important. My , by far, biggest pet peeve is about the main bad guy , Bob Skyllum >!we never learn why he went mad, crashed his ship, tried to kill the MC and his 'brother' , why those two kids were raised amidst android children, how they are related to the other SEED specimens, and why Bob just...died. like, his arm was acting up  again, he tells some cryptic shit to pink-hair guy and we don't even SEE him dying.!<"

The story is decent but comes nowhere near the levels of story other animes with the same popularity have 

I would still go to see the movie as the anime CARRIES THE STORY HARD, the manga is insufferable."

The movie has an amazing soundtrack, and has amazing animation. However, the story sounds like it's written through ChatGPT due to the fact that the movie only tells instead of shows. What I mean by this is, you don't fully see character development, the characters will tell you if they're developed."

AscendPerfect,2020-09-14,"Think ive watched sao season 1 atleast 15 times.

People keep making fun of sao, but the themes are all perfect for me (vr), other world, stuck in another ""world"", romance. And the music and animations is peak. Animation is beggining to fall a bit behind, but when it was released it was as good as it got.

A lot of people don't like the story, but for the people that do like it, it is usually their fsvorite anime."
Siphe-M,2021-09-15,"Agreed. Yuki Kajiura carried that series so hard…along with LiSA, Reona and Eir Aoi tbh."
SunKillerLullaby,2022-09-15,"I feel like there’s so much wasted potential there. I wish Aincrad had been the focus of the whole first season. It had the potential to explore some interesting themes, but ultimately it felt rushed. Alfheim wasn’t nearly as good.

ravenpotter3,2019-01-28,Once I realized the protagonist and antagonist are literally just Amuro and char from Gundam but like shallower I just didn’t care anymore. And it’s fine to have characters who are inspired by famous rivalries in stories… it’s common actually. But the story adds nothing to it. I have no reason to care for the protagonist I can’t remember the name of… like in season 2 he acts robotic and like emotionless. It’s like the story did not give me reasons to stay or be invested in the characters. Or the world.

GliTchDragon1,2017-03-23,"I would argue that solo leveling has a seemingly simplistic story with very good storytelling.

It uses the animation to tell the story oftentimes, which I find to be a very good way of telling a story for certain situations in some visual media like anime. Beyond that, it really is a power fantasy so it becomes ""go there and beat up this character,""  ""get stronger,"" and ""show off the gained power in the next battle,"" rinse and repeat. Personally, I see little details they add to keep it interesting, but overall, it is more simple than, say, your average season of My Hero Academia.

I could imagine some people find it boring for being simplistic, so they would naturally dislike it and even think it is bad writing. I personally think that doesn't necessarily mean it has a bad story, it's just reasonably not going to appeal to everyone."

No one really thinks it is trash actually. Because reddit is a infinite hellhole where only the negative rises, people only act like sheeps without making their own opinions and get lead by their shepherds which are the popular opinions. Naruto is not trash or anything, it has a simple but fun story and really really cool powers. But because people hate and it rises other people start to agree it is trash."

Hunter x Hunter tho, peak shounen battle manga which has now become a seinen battle manga imo. Manga is peak ofc, if only we got more chapters

Entertainment Arc was my favorite and idc for the rest anymore. Not everyone is a sheep and jump on the hate bandwagon. I don't get why people hyped it when I first started it. Maybe its understandable for new anime watchers.

Naruto? It gradually got worse. I stop before the war started because I can't stand it. He botched a lot of thing. Anything I find interesting is gone after a while.

I don't need complicated story really. Demon Slayer for me is like the author doesn't even try. Naruto as we know is the author pulling new things out of his asses everytime (Probably because of the manga schedule or something?)

Half of the shounen is a miss to me. Maybe you can guess which one is a hit for me?"
Black_nYello,2020-05-03,"Agreed that Naruto’s story is better than demon slayer’s, I just meant that they’re both battle shonen with at least passable if not straight up good stories.

asianwaste,2010-10-06,"I'd probably add one more tier for ""Hobbies and Specific Interests""

one thing that manga/anime does that a lot of other cultural spheres of pop culture stray away from is they make shows about topics you wouldn't think would be remotely interesting or there's an attempt and others don't quite make them as compelling or authentic.

Anime and Manga can make stories about sewing and somehow it'd be a hit.

Examples:  Hi-Score Girl for videogaming, Yuru Camp for camping, Sabege-bu for airsoft, Food Wars for Cooking, Girls und Panzer for military tank enthusiasts, etc.


I'd also say Bochi and Kids on the Slope belong on another category for music.  There are plenty of other examples for SoL that are purely dedicated to being shows about nothing.  Aggretsuko for young adult struggles, Nichijou for screwball takes, Shirobako for workplace (unless you want workplace to be another category)"

Niirai,2014-09-02,"So I'm going through GTO currently and even as a veteran anime degenerate, it's pretty hard to stomach sometimes. Literal first scene is the MC looking up a schoolgirls' skirt, then the rest of the episode it's the MC geeking over wanting a 16 yo schoolgirl bride, as a 22 yo. And they keep hammering on the the age gap thing, that the girls really are 16. 

Certain episodes are worse than others, but horning over schoolgirls keeps coming back by our adult MC teacher. And then there's the vice-principle and PE teacher similarly horning over the schoolgirls and even physically harassing them. And while those characters are portrayed as pervs, the anime mostly plays it as humorous."

MawrtiniTheGreat,2017-11-06,"There is a lot wrong with this list but the biggest thing for me is: How in the hell does one classify Mushishi as ""light spiritual mysteries""?

Mushishi has to be among the most heartwrenching shows I've seen. 

Guy walks around in a stagnant backwards world terrorized by mindless ""things"" that are 1/3 bacteria, 1/3 dangerous spirits and 1/3 parasites. The ""things"" effectively hinder all progress because the make life so hard, so now the world is stuck forever in the late middle ages, with all the poverty and strife related to that.
Why does he walk around? See he had his life ruined by these ""things"" that terrorize the world and now he is basically cursed to have them flock around him, and since he is a decent guy he can never stay in one place for more than a short while, thus causing him to be alone forever with no real connections to anyone. 
How does he survive then, not being able to put down roots or even have a home? Well, because of his curse, he has come to know the ""things"" very well and has learnt partially how to handle them, so in his travels he works as a plague doctor/exorcist/investigator/shaman. The only problem is that you usually don't notice the symptoms of the ""things"" until it's too late, so in most cases the best thing he can do is provide some poor man's version of closure to the grief stricken family/village. Then it is time to go, just when he has started to form some connection, before his curse calls down more misfortune on the poor souls living there, so on to the next soul killing tragedy we go. Rinse and repeat every episode.

It is a damn good show, but ""light spiritual mysteries"" it is not. More ""the soul killing fate of a cursed plague doctor""."

Adizcool,2018-11-24,"I'm not sure about Spy x Family being the best recommendation for comedy. It is a very slicer of life heavy and very rarely has jokes that make you laugh out loud. If the person is not into slice of life, which I feel is most people who have never seen anime, they will leave the show feeling very bored. 
And why does Blue Lock have bloody warning on it lol. I guess it is intense, but it never got like bloody or something."

Plaincow,2011-06-24,"Tbh good recommendations except the romance part(and basically all of the ""pure fun"" shows.)

One punch man is an absolute banger than I believe most adults will love. The rest of the ""pure fun"" shows will be a disaster if someone watches those when new I think lmao.

I think toradora as a beginner anime will off put a TON of people with how Taiga looks and act.

I think kaguya is a little too out there for people that are new to anime also. It has a TON of tropes that will weird out people who are new to anime and likely just put them off. Especially if they are adults

Otherwise A very solid chart tbh."

xKarmaHakase,2021-09-01,"Alright so, Attack on Titan for best drama not action, Japanese dub tho. Your Name and Your Lie in April for Romance, Tokyo Ghoul for Drama. Action I'd go Demon Slayer or JJK as first. Realistically tho Dragonball should be the picture for action and One Piece for Adventure. Some takes I agree with, some definitely not. Also, Clannad (underrated af) should go to romance or drama as well (more romance cause drama for a romance anime always kinda spoils that something bad is gonna happen and than that's all you think about)"
moogoo2,2010-02-23,I disagree with this.
FerroLux_,2019-07-11,"I have been wondering since it has released:

Is Frieren an anime for beginners?

The anime has very little sexual innuendos, very cool yet simple world building, great characters, story and visuals. 

And yet, by definition, Frieren takes for granted that you know about the classic trope “the hero party is on a journey to defeat the Demon King” and builds its narrative upon it."
[eliminado],,"I always wonder why they choose the more ""normie"" anime to new anime fans, I mean, if you really are grossed out by the ""weird anime shit"" you should be watching something else I guess.

I think for a lot of people if they see a lot of girls in a non action show, that automatically puts the show into the Slice of Life bucket whether it warrants it or not."
LakerBlue,2013-01-31,"Yes I have been arguing this since it was still airing.

LilyGinnyBlack,2017-08-29,"Agreed. There was actually a post on the Fruits Basket subreddit the other day that was specifically about someone being disappointed in Fruits Basket because it was recommended to them as a romance. This isn't the first time I've seen that kind of reaction to Furuba either. Fruits Basket has romance in it, but the main focus of the series is more on the drama surrounding the Sohma Family as a whole and on healing from trauma and breaking cycles of abuse. There's a lot of more focus placed on familial and platonic relationships in Furuba than romantic ones."
DegenerateSock,2018-01-29,"~~I think I agree, but I can see an argument for having a broader selection of flavours of romance.~~ Nvm, I just looked at the drama section and Your Name is way more romance and less drama than Fruits Basket. Those two should switch.

Personally, I'd move Kimi ni Todoke out of there, but that's mostly because I'm still pissed at it for how S2 started."

MrNewVegas123,2018-01-25,"This is why Death Note is a perfect introductory anime. Relies almost entirely on the suspense factor, few to no obvious or obscure Japanese cultural references. Entirely digestible to western audiences.

Do I enjoy watching Gintama more than Death Note? Yes, but that doesn't mean someone who hasn't seen anime before is going to be interested in having the baka kanji reading explained to them as part of a joke."
BigHTimeBus,2023-04-25,"Truly, I don't know what the label ""Pure Fun"" is meant to convey. One Punch Man certainly fits as I would expect as it's pretty much exactly how it presents itself. I don't want to use the words 'shallow' or 'superficial' because they carry pejorative connotation, but there's not a ton of depth to what it's doing or trying to do. (that's fine, I love OPM because it *is* a ton of fun and Saitama being underwhelmed by his opponents is funny and great, even if the show tries to have a plot about him earning the prestige he thinks he's owed). Even then, a lot of the villains show up with Godzilla level ""I am the symbolic manifestation of some evil or injustice and I have come to take my revenge"" sort of thing going on.

But Kill La Kill and FLCL both require a fair amount of literacy to untangle what's going on. KLK is a bit flashier and can be enjoyed on a prurient superficial level, but there absolutely is more going on than nudity and fight scenes. Even if you aren't aware of the creator commentary about its class and political themes, the text of the show is pretty up front about it.

And FLCL is an abstract psycho-sexual exploration of adolescence. It's all about a horny kid coming to grips with his sexuality and the expectations of growing up, but all of that exceeds his grasp, and it's all presented in layers of dream symbolism. It's a fuckin (robots coming out of a) head trip and I can't imagine recommending it to a beginner anything unless the beginner in question was already a big fan of David Lynch or something. Labeling it ""Pure Fun"" defies explanation, unless you watch it and ignore the 95% of the (very short) show that doesn't include robots fighting.

I can't speak to Panty and Stocking as I haven't seen it, but it's done by Gainax who also did FLCL and Evangelion, so there's a fair chance there's more to it than titillation."
Pie_Slayer,2019-03-07,Kinda agree I've watched 3 out of the 4 pure fun and FLCL was more weird than fun and kill la kill was interesting...
potato_devourer,2020-04-29,FCLC keeps a surreal and energized tone but through all the innuendo and allegory it deals with surprisingly intense topics.
Bushidoenator,2019-02-28,"Yeah, like, wheres nichijou?"
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,"Everything in Pure Fun has been popular with newcomers since they came out. Not every single person is going to like them, but a lot of people will. There's an indicator of if they have titillating content, and people can make up their mind on if that's a deal breaker or not."
yashknight,2016-03-16,"I recently got a coworker interested in anime, and she was complaining about unfinished shows so I came up with this. Should be beginner friendly for most part.

Menacek,2016-11-18,"I think having a bit broader spectrum of options in a category is better that having all of the options be similar to one another.

I don't really watch sports show but i assume it's probly there because it's different than ""high schoolers play ball sports"""
frankie_yuki98,2024-07-14,"I see your point but kinda disagree. As someone who enjoys watching ballet and figure skating (both of which are sports), the sports aspect was the main reason I watched Yuri on ice. The romance and music were just nice bonuses 😅"
SkepticalSpiderboi,2018-09-18,Lmao I watched yuri on ice for the romance
ezkailez,2018-08-12,i feel like most good anime of their preferred genre is a good beginner anime.
TheXtractor,2016-05-31,Well the idea is that someone with no idea isn't just going to pick a random anime cuz they have no idea what to look for. Which makes these kind of guides helpful since they can choose from a small selection without being overwhelmed.
Flex_6969,2019-08-25,"What do you mean ? It was my first anime and i loved how serious and deep it could get, before i thought anime is just like some fun thing to watch when you're bored and toradora changed my view on anime.
Edit: that was also like 3 years ago so not that long"
Durinthal,2010-11-15,Are newcomers to anime now significantly different from people that watched it as one of their first anime 10-15 years ago and liked it then?
Escolyte,2017-10-09,"There's a shocking lack of Tsuki ga Kirei mentions for romance not only in the chart, but the entire thread."
sajhino,2014-07-27,I love Psycho Pass but I feel that it's too gory and grotesque to recommend as a beginner's anime.
pm_me_your_zettai,2023-01-29,Nichijou.
offoy,2012-03-27,I kinda feel like spy x family is more slice of life than comedy (is it even funny?).
AllSortsOfPeopleHere,2022-10-19,">IMO it’s a bit heavier than some others for anyone trying to start watching anime

Are you saying that someone new to anime can't handle that? Pretty sure most anime newbies won't find anything in *Psycho-Pass* harder to consume than what they've probably already come across in live action, novels or whatever."
Nachtwandler_FS,2016-01-02,"Also, Saksmichi no Apollon is quite heavy for a SoL."
hydre39,2021-01-03,"I think ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"" would be a far better choice.  


1: It's a bit known outside of anime because of the film

  
2: Contrary to psycho pass it make sense 

3: It's REALLY good"
l_i_t_t_l_e_m_o_n_ey,,"how did it score the premiere spot for sci fi over akira or ghost in the shell, wtf

or even cyberpunk edgerunners, that would be good for beginners."
jimbo80008,2019-08-17,"Well it is not like the chart is trying to hide it with the ""heavy NSFW"" label (seems a bit out of proportion for kill la kill in the general perspective of anime, but I guess it works for this list)"
QuasimodoPredicted,2018-02-12,It was actually my first anime 10 years ago ;)
Humg12,2013-09-14,"It entirely depends on who the ""beginner"" is. A horny high school kid might love a fan service heavy show, but you wouldn't necessarily show it to your mother."
Confuzn,2013-03-21,Also that first ep of GTO (and a lot of it tbh) has aged extremely poorly I wouldn’t show that to anyone for their first anime. The MC is basically a pedo and even though he learns to be better over time it takes a while for the show to get to that point.
Kyleometers,2014-03-16,"I wouldn’t say the fan service is the biggest problem, I would say the fact that it’s parodying decades of anime tropes is the problem. You’re just not going to understand like 75% of the gags if you’ve not watched many other anime before it."
KilroyWagner69,2023-08-16,"Ask some visual novel fans, and they will tell you Saya no Uta is the most beginner-friendly entry the medium has to offer simply because of how short it is."
OneMoreChancee,2015-08-22,Agreed. Yes those shows always get heavily critiqued but they are all great at drawing people into anime.
oedipusrex376,2019-11-25,"Demon Slayer is like the Pokemon of Shounen (aim all ages). It’s the perfect starter anime. Even non-anime watcher in Japan (obaachan etc) watches it. Non weeb models even cosplay as Nezuko. It’s one of those anime that doesn’t have stigma because it’s so popular, like Kimi no Nawa."
toadfan64,2013-08-14,"I just finished Toradora for the first time and found it to be great. I was a bit annoyed with her violence at first, but that was really my only critique. Aged great to this first time watcher."
Thehawkiscock,2012-05-17,"I watched Toradora last year, it was good and didn’t seem like something that felt aged at all"
Abysswatcherbel,2019-04-15,">violent tsunderes aren't popular anymore.

Yeah, I am see that every season..... /s"
SpikeRosered,2012-11-18,"I think this lists makes the mistake that not all ""beginner anime"" are classics.

Back in the day a lot of people called Nadesico a great beginner anime because it had all the anime ""stuff"" in it. Wasn't the best show, but it was a good introduction to what anime was."
Revealingstorm,2011-11-20,Since when has it aged bad? I still see it talked about a bunch in a good light
Dialgak77,2017-05-04,"> No SAO, Demon Slayer, MHA? These are THE beginner anime.

Naruto, Bleach and One Piece were the beginner anime before those existed and they still are."
goodnames679,2012-11-23,"Criticizing Toradora for ageing like milk while putting SAO on your list is... a take. 

Toradora's still a good show that is well liked by many, even if Taiga's style of character isn't that popular these days. SAO is good at attracting newbies because of S1, but I've also seen a couple people get scared back off from anime because of its incest plotline starting in S2. If someone wanted to get into anime with a story about the MC being taken to another world where they're OP, there are *so many* better options these days."
YuasaLee_AL,2019-02-26,"I can think of so many people who burned out on the medium based on watching those shows. I think the ideal beginner anime are 13 or 26 episodes, and the exceptions OP picked have a way higher satisfaction rate."
wildbee12,2019-04-23,"Fruits Basket especially in the romance section is a weird one I wouldn't agree with. When I think of romance recommendations, I think of series that are more *focused* on romance or where romance is the main ""plot"" of the series. It would fit better in drama. 

Kids on the slope is another weird one, feel like it would fit better in drama instead of SOL. Natsume's book of friends is relatively popular and would've been a better pick for SOL."
futfb,,?
beauhatesbeans,2021-12-21,IKR 😭😭💔💔
NoraJolyne,2018-06-18,ikr? list doesn't even have Utena smh
AllSortsOfPeopleHere,2022-10-19,"The most popular shoujo on anilist is *Banana Fish*, ranked ""#106 most popular all time"" and on MAL, it's *Ouran*, at #130.

When not even anime fans are watching shoujo, I think OP has done alright with 2."
PM_ME_YOUR_HOLOCRONS,2017-11-07,GTO on a beginner chart is insane in my opinion
bricktoaster,2016-10-10,"Yeah that's the first thing I noticed. I had to drop it after the first couple episodes because while I could tell it was a product of a different era, it really romanticizes what we recognize as predators today. ""But it's fine because the mc is one of the good ones that actually cares"" is such a problematic sentiment. 

GTO is definitely for veteran anime watchers that are used to problematic sexualization in otherwise decent stories. Trying to recommend it to beginners is a surefire way to reinforce all the negative stereotypes regarding anime and anime watchers."
souji5okita,2016-10-18,As hard as it is to admit GTO has not aged well. It's a product of its time in Japan. I would never recommend this as a starter anime to a friend.
ConnectionIcy3717,2023-06-14,"Lots of old shows have that. Heck even today some shows use that as comedy.
""Oh look! Its boobs/panty shot! Hahahah! Absolute hilarity!"" 
Its jarring to say the least"
Falsus,2013-06-27,The best starter anime should be the stuff closest to what other media you like.
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,"Yeah, I'm a pretty firm believer that ""beginner anime"" is a bad concept that often forces people into really narrow band of what counts as ""beginner"". This one is at least reasonably varied though."
Sesemebun,2023-10-24,"To a degree, but if I showed someone Mushoku tensei and Rent-a-girlfriend as their first anime, and told them they were some of the most popular atm, it wouldn’t exactly frame the anime industry very well. 

Golden boy is a fav of mine but I wouldn’t tell people to watch it as a first since the “tendencies” of manga authors can be a bit shocking to people not used to it."
emolano,2020-09-27,"My mom's first anime was Akira. Since them she always reminds me she dislikes ""drawings"""
LakerBlue,2013-01-31,"I disagree “any” anime should be a beginner one but I do agree most lists like these are unnecessarily restrictive. There are far more anime I would recommend than wouldn’t as beginner options: 

- anything super horny like High School DxD (most young males excluded)
- something that works best as a parody or satire like Eminence of Shadow (I think if you have seen 1-2 Isekai or at least familiar with chuunis you will enjoy it much more)
- probably The Monogatari Series."
[eliminado],,[deleted]
mana-addict4652,2020-07-21,"Yeah if people gave me just ""accessible"" anime to start with (depending on their definition) I'd be bored."
tokyozombie,2013-04-07,Eureka Seven mentioned!
soulonfirexx,2008-09-24,So happy Planetes is on here. Such a great series.
ant900,2011-08-11,I was middling on some of the choices until I got to Eureka Seven.  Perfect list. A+++
Konzan,2020-09-11,I. CAN. FLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Slorg_Salad,2019-11-19,"Agreed, it might be my favorite anime"
frankie_yuki98,2024-07-14,I thought the same. You could argue it’s too confusing and mindbending but Akira is in the list and that’s just as out-there
huf72,2020-10-15,"I’m surprised by the lack of Eva mention as well, usually not having evangelion on a mecha tier list would be like a sin to older anime heads. Are we getting old or something?"
SkepticalSpiderboi,2018-09-18,I’m watching dungeon meshi right now and it SLAPS. Definitely should be on a starters list. I get the same feeling from it as I do from like spy x family
Alkafer,2014-11-27,"For recommending anime to actual newcomers, I find the Weeb Ass Shit method very useful. It's stupid? Yes. It works? 9 out of 10 times. Also works for people who ""don't like anime because *insert your favorite prejudice or misconception*"""
mana-addict4652,2020-07-21,"If someone recommended MHA to me I'd be bored, newbies can enjoy crazy shit and they often need a good hook.

*But* it depends on the genres they're into, based on the other media they consume."
SDRPGLVR,2023-01-17,">shows like Kill La kill are a sure fire way to ensure all the typical stereotypes people associate with anime are maintained. 

I think this is an outdated mindset. Some of the biggest shows on TV are things like Game of Thrones and The Boys. Bridgerton borders on hardcore porno sometimes. 

If you tell people to expect something MA-level, I struggle to see how something like KLK could be seen as too pervy for modern TV audiences."
h13xiii,2022-05-05,"Agreed, great starting point for beginners and most of these have good depth and plot. Nice selection!"
DjappaT,2020-06-08,I've been doing these charts for a few months. The chart you saw in 2016 might have been [this one by lukeatlook.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5326no/recommendation_chart_for_beginners_oc/)
SkepticalSpiderboi,2018-09-18,"So true. Literally everything about it was perfect, with how human and relatable the characters were and the way they depicted travel so… accurately, more accurately and more detailed than I’ve ever seen in any anime ever. Not to mention the character progression and the bittersweet yet beautiful ending. Everyone should watch this"
Michudachi,2024-06-15,"Is... this a common take? I was hooked by the first episode. I thought the slow build up and mystery and aggregation of deviations made the entire journey enthralling and made the ending payoff that much more fantastic. Of all the bad suggestions in this list, Steins;Gate is definitely on the better half IMO"
GrimasVessel227,2017-07-14,"Yeah it's pretty damn bizarre that things like DBZ, Naruto and Pokemon, etc. aren't on here"
TheSpoonyCroy,2014-11-10,"I mean it depends on how you define beginner. Firstly glad it is a show that is even remembered but I can see one saying its a great way to show how anime can show* very thoughtful concepts without many of the usual anime tropes that can be off putting for non anime watchers or references that may not be understood. I think a very good thing about anime as medium is its not really pigeonholed for ""kids"". While in the west we are slowing working on getting rid of that stigma but its not unfair to say animation is still viewed primarily for ""family entertainment""."
Used_Entrance_5393,2021-08-06,"The show is about a spy, an assassin, and a mind reader. Almost none of the situations in it fit a slice of life, and the only times the show does touch on aspects of family or school life it's as a way to poke fun at it or set the situation on its ear. Action and comedy are its primary genres."
nico_juro,2023-11-15,"Yeah I don't laught at Spy x Family much, didn't even realize it would be considered a comedy. Love is War however, is the funniest shit I've ever seen"
DarkConan1412,2017-03-17,"SpyxFamily was hilarious, especially in s1! 😂 Mostly, it's the reactions and just how over the top Yor is at times. I'll agree that it is possibly more of a female type of comedy being more based on character interactions. The kids killed me at times. Mainly, the boy, Damian. I'm such a tsundere fan. I just can't help it! I do enjoy absurdist comedy as well."
Cheesemacher,2013-03-31,"Slice of life stuff doesn't generally hold my interest, but I love Spy x Family for the action and comedy"
Domoquadrant,2018-12-30,"It makes sense, given how it exploded in popularity when it released and got many ice skaters and other athletes and sports fans into anime. Hell, there was even a routine in that winter Olympics that used a song from the show (RIP the movie though)"
SkepticalSpiderboi,2018-09-18,"Probably not popular enough. My personal opinion is that it’s one of the best anime of all time, but it just doesn’t appeal to a very wide audience"
kanon_despreocupado,2016-04-12,"gintama its not beginner friendly, you need to know at least 50-60% of the references"
ConnectionIcy3717,2023-06-14,"Tons of new anime fans also fall in love with mass murders from shonens like DS, JJK and Bnha. I dont think a tsundere or kaguya-sama will put them off. Especially if they are adults."
cheesecakegood,2014-09-17,"> Attack on Titan for best drama not action

????"
charactergallery,2022-06-06,That plot isn’t really unique to anime by any means. It’s quite universal and straightforward.
Falsus,2013-06-27,"Many people, even without the context of other anime, will understand the Hero party thing.

It is like imagining the LotR Fellowship after the ring is destroyed."
ConnectionIcy3717,2023-06-14,"That classic trope is there in novels, movies, D&Ds, games so its rather very popular and easily digestible"
unnecessary_overkill,2016-06-30,it's literally just D&D
SpectreRedditor,2022-02-25,Man who tf puts Made in Abyss in an Anime Beginners List 💀
[eliminado],,"Iirc DxD was also on there

Starring on beginner anime list: Porn!"
astralseat,2023-12-13,Imagine watching that anime and thinking all anime is like that. Horrible first anime to get the feel for it. Amazing anime for seasoned watchers.
Humg12,2013-09-14,"I don't see anything wrong with that. It's a very unique anime, and there's definitely a group of people that would enjoy MiA, but not most other anime, so starting them with that would make sense. Anime is often weird. Shying away from that would be doing it a diservice imo."
DarkConan1412,2017-03-17,"Awww. Haruhi was something I saw early on. I enjoyed the series. It was something like my 5th anime. Somewhere around there. Early on, I saw about 10 or so anime all around the same time as a newbie fan. A little here, a little there. Just whatever my friend group put on during that time. IMO, this experience showed me how many different shows were out there under the anime umbrella."
Trebu5,2023-02-18,"I don’t think Akira is beginner either, I showed my friend once who loved Deathnote and he was freaked out by it lol"
DarkConan1412,2017-03-17,"That could’ve been alright for viewers who want more R rated content. So, anime isn’t seen as something only for children. I haven’t seen DxD though. All I know is it’s R rated and an ecchi type series."
Falsus,2013-06-27,"Not necessarily. 

For example litRPG is the biggest subgenre of Fantasy in the world atm. They are very casual friendly (hence why they are so common in isekai among others)

Historical shows like Vinland Saga or The Apothecary Diaries is another pretty big niche.

Absurd action flick is another. If someone pops up asking for a Tarantino flick in anime form it would be easy to mention Akiba Maid Wars."
Blabime,2016-01-20,"Is this the chart you're looking for?

Shantotto11,2016-04-15,Sailor Moon for the beginners; Kill la Kill for the aficionados…
8andahalfby11,2015-01-22,"Wish someone would make one for other genres, like mecha and isekai."
Gonazar,2009-10-06,"I feel like that'd be a fun thing to do.

My two charts would be all the anime that uses healing in a weird way (because that spectrum is pretty wide between Parallel World Pharmacy and Redo) and a watch order for all the shows Takehito koyasu has VA'd"
Contren,2008-09-02,Absolutely for K-On! A Place Further Than The Universe is a mix between SoL and Adventure.
Pokefreaker-san,2018-04-09,A Place Further than the universe is an adventure series. K-On and Yorimoi arent even in the same genre despite having similar group of casts
Pokefreaker-san,2018-04-09,"a place further than the universe is first and foremost an adventure show. it's a coming of age stories that has a beggining and an end.


people mislabeling SoL all the time"
Contren,2008-09-02,"Season 2 of K-On has more emotional beats, but it's definitely still a SoL primarily. 

The two (Bocchi and K-On!) do hit some similar story beats, but the core themes are different."
mileylols,2010-12-19,BOOSTO
duga404,2023-11-12,"Mine was Girls und Panzer lmao, some guy I played War Thunder with recommended it"
Jaggedmallard26,2012-09-26,I feel like if you go into anime before streaming became the main way people watched things your first anime is going to be whatever was either playing on adult swim (or a similar channel) that caught your eye when high or a VHS you found intriguing. Everyone I knew back then had a different weird first anime. Not counting things sold as regular cartoons like Pokemon of course.
Hephaestus_God,2016-03-28,Mine was “C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control”
hungryhograt,2020-01-15,"My first was quite basic, Bleach… my second, third and fourth however… those were interesting choices. My second was Higurashi, third was Gantz, fourth was Elfen lied…"
Ralkon,2012-07-14,"I feel like that depends more on the individual than on any specific show though. Outside of heavily referential things or just plain bad titles, it's better to just watch something that actually looks interesting than something people recommend as being easy to get into."
shifty1032231,2012-08-04,I didn't know the manga was still going. What chapter does it pick up after Roberta's Revenge arc?
sarybelle,2019-09-11,"I get heated every time I think about season 2, it was like starting season 1 all over again"
IamXale,2016-08-26,"Man, S2 pissed me off so much that I kind of was just indifferent to everything in the show towards the end. Jokes stopped being funny and the payoff at the end didn't even feel satisfying."
abbaschand,2017-12-24,"I can see why. Once you see Horimiya, any other romance show becomes bland, especially with how fast Horimiya goes through with their relationship."
Gamerunglued,2017-05-30,"I think the even bigger insult is calling Kill la Kill ""pure fun"" and not ""political satire about fascism and class disparity for those who like over-the-top cartoon sex and violence."" Kill la Kill has so much more going for it than being fun, the brainy among us will still find tons to love about it."
Ebo87,2014-08-16,"I was surprised how many people got into anime with something like Kill la Kill... it's awesome, love to hear that, but I'm not sure I would have it on the list as a starter anime. Depends what you call beginner, I guess your 20th anime is fine, maybe."
SkepticalSpiderboi,2018-09-18,Was looking for this comment. I watched FLCL years after I got into anime and I still didn’t know what the fuck was happening. I’d even recommend jojo’s bizarre adventure to a first timer over that one
redherringbones,2018-12-30,And where's fumoffu?
Super1d,2012-03-02,Props for listig rakugo. It is so good
[eliminado],,"I'd add Samurai Champloo somewhere though. It has comedy, action and a good story + great music of course."
Used_Entrance_5393,2021-08-06,"If it was a list of like Best Anime I would shy away from listing shows that aren't completed, but this is basically an anime introductory list so I think it's fine. I know a handful of people who don't really watch much anime who love Spy x Family so far it seems to be a pretty good beginner anime even if it's still running."
Chrysalis-,,Frieren is coming back!
Protractror,2014-04-23,"Eh, there are definitely some questionable picks (Panty and Stocking do not need to be here lol) but I think the overall list just has a few smaller issues. I remember the original, this is a big step up."
GrowlyBear2,2016-12-16,"Nozaki kun was one of my first anime and usually one of the first I use to introduce girls to anime. You don't need to understand all the references for it to be funny, and it does a good job of setting up the jokes so that you understand them before it gives you the punchline. Also, being an author, and unrequited love is something a lot of people have an understanding of."
Pewterator,2023-08-09,Ye ig im just talking for my fellow sweaty male counterparts but that doesnt discredit ice skating as a sport at all its just from my perspective it feels a little out of place next to blue lock and hajime no ippo
LilyGinnyBlack,2017-08-29,"Not really on the topic of what makes for a sports anime, but If you enjoy watching ballet and haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend Princess Tutu. It's a fantastic magical girl anime that mixes ballet with fairytales and the magical girl genre."
falafelnagrubym,2022-11-04,Yes
1998tweety,2014-04-06,"It kind of depends. 10-15 years ago to me it felt like you either watched a lot of anime or not at all outside of Studio Ghilbi films, Pokémon, Sailor Moon, and maybe Dragon Ball/OP/Naruto/Bleach when you were young. So even if you were new to anime, you'd usually stick with it even if something was off putting. Nowadays there are a lot more (for lack of a better word) normies getting into anime, watching stuff like JJK, Demon Slayer, MHA, etc. and something like Toradora might scare them off."
[eliminado],,"Yes, most people back then didn’t watch it as first anime. It’s mostly nostalgia, because now there’s way better romance anime to recommend as first anime"
Falsus,2013-06-27,Violent tsunderes aren't popular right now and people view Taiga as a violent abuser nowadays.
toadfan64,2013-08-14,"Weirdly enough Azumanga drew me in right away, but I have still yet to really get into Nichijou after a few episodes."
Yveltal_25,2017-11-16,"Spy x family is funny. But I guess because it’s set in a serious setting with plenty of jokes, it’s not looked as a comedy. 

I find it hilarious, not as much as Azumanga, but it is funny."
Candle1ight,2023-09-21,"A ""heavy NSFW"" label shouldn't exist on a beginners list tbh"
Breakdown007,2016-06-01,"I dunno. Try recommending someone a 500+ episodes series, most will say no thanks. I think the barrier to entry for JJK, DS and MHA is much thinner."
1998tweety,2014-04-06,"The way people consume anime (and media in general) has changed though. Back when I was a kid those 3 were all among my starter anime but it was more cause I turned on the TV and watched what was on and if I missed an episode it usually wasn't a huge deal cause of slow pacing, plenty of recaps, and the epic fights being a big highlight.

If you're a young kid I'd sonner recommend SAO/DS/MHA over those 3 classic picks because you can quickly consume it all."
Breakdown007,2016-06-01,"I'm not saying that Toradora is a bad anime just that in my opinion it's not a good anime for beginners. Taiga punches the MC in the face, destroys property and breaks into people's houses. People are way more sensitive and critical of such behavior nowadays and there are plenty of romance shows that are just a better fit for beginners."
_Ridley,2020-02-18,"Yeah, I wasn't even going to start with the genres. Fruits Basket is a drama with a romantic sub-plot, Kids on the Slope is in no way a slice of life, neither is Bocchi, Kaguya is a comedy, and so on.

And if I were doing this, I'd put Natsume's Book of Friends in sol, Yona of the Dawn in adventure, Snow White with the Red Hair in Fantasy, and the Rose of Versailles in drama."
LakerBlue,2013-01-31,I agree. I love the romance in the show but it is primarily a drama.
lfairy,2012-04-24,"I love Utena but I don't think it's a beginner anime. Unless the ""beginner"" in question is a fan of David Lynch."
_Ridley,2020-02-18,Where are all the shounen and seinen from this list on the popularity charts?
Niirai,2014-09-02,"GTO really goes all in on this stuff though, there's entire episodes and arcs dedicated to the sex appeal of specifically young, highschool girls. Modern shows have learned to keep it as vague as possible, give girls birthdays but not birth years etc. GTO is just saying all the quiet parts out loud, [it's kind of hilarious in a way.](https://i.imgur.com/KPXIIHi.jpeg) That's just from the first episode btw which ends with a wholesome turn of events. And the conclusion after that wholesomeness? Having a 16 yo girls panties in his face after getting flashed."
TabbyMicrobe919,2020-10-12,Facts my guy this is the answer everyone needs to remember
TabbyMicrobe919,2020-10-12,Well of course but that’s why giving warnings or asking what they like before suggesting something would work well enough. Those are some good examples of ones to give warnings of tho lol
World79,2013-06-18,"That's not an issue of the anime though, that's an issue of you being bad at suggesting things to watch and not considering the person. 
Just because I wouldn't recommend Demon Slayer to my mom, doesn't mean it's a bad beginner anime."
Michudachi,2024-06-15,"I think what they are saying is that a lot of times what we suggest or think of as ""beginner"" anime are really just very sterile and part of what makes Anime fun is how weird and unique they can be. That doesn't mean jumping to something like Kill la Kill though, and I think context matters about who you're recommending too. 

Mawaru Penguindrum, Polar Bear Cafe, Humanity has Declined, Arakawa Under the Bridge, Space Dandy... like I may not recommend those to a middle aged woman but including an option that is a bit wacky isn't a bad thing either. There are people who get hooked on anime because of how wild it can be. One of my friends, his like 3rd anime as Made in Abyss, he didn't even watch it in order but has basically jump started his dive into the medium."
TabbyMicrobe919,2020-10-12,"That’s true, but you should be able to weed out the shows you wouldn’t like with some simple research. So if someone recommends me kill la kill as a middle aged woman, all I have to do is look into it a bit and I’ll realize easily that it’s not the one to watch. It’s better than getting the same rec as 90% of anime watchers. Also, you may be selling middle aged women short hahah. I get your point tho"
SoupTurbulence,,Hmm i remember watching it on adult swim but i think its time to go back because i dont remember any of the plot.
PainStorm14,2016-04-10,"Best one ever made, I can't sing enough praises to it"
MDCCCLV,2015-05-19,Akira and evangelion were one of the earliest and most prominent big anime but they also just happened to be some of the weirdest ever made. It's a crazy start.
SuperBackup9000,2021-12-09,"There’s been a lot of shift in the mindset over the years. Like a lot of EVA fans forget that it’s not a secret that they’re not actually robots, because it says in the first episode or two that they’re organic, so how are you going to have a robot anime without any robots? Doesn’t really fit when it’s missing the one defining factor.

It’s mecha themed, that’s definitely not wrong, but I remember there being a lot of big debates that if EVA is technically a mecha, then Attack on Titan is also technically a mecha, and that makes no one happy."
Nihilus88,2016-08-18,Oh I see. Nice chart anyway!
MrMonday11235,2012-07-27,"It is definitely a common take that Steins;Gate takes almost a dozen episodes to ""get good"", taken to mean ""the plot stops being a slow burn"". A lot of people are not fans of slow burns, and that's fine. Heck, I consider myself a fan of those kinds of stories (I was a big fan of ACCA 13), and even I found the start a bit hard to bear... Though a lot of that was also how grating I initially found Okabe's character to be.

Whether that disqualifies it from this kind of list or not... I don't have enough information to say whether that's a common take or not."
twiz___twat,2015-10-24,"loved teh show, but yah the first half was slow and boring."
AllSortsOfPeopleHere,2022-10-19,">you need to know at least 50-60% of the references

Just want to point out that *Gintama* was running in a magazine targeted at teen boys in the 2000s, while still referencing manga from the '80s. Not even *Gintama*'s original target audience understood many of the references. You can get by without understanding most of them.

Plus, *Gintama* is getting older, and many of its references are for things that aired \~15+ years ago. Even if you watch many of the popular stuff of today, you might find yourself not getting many of its references when you eventually do get around to it. And, let's be real - a huge portion of people who are waiting till they're in a position to understand the references will never actually get around to watching it.

That said, I do agree that unless someone is really looking for something like *Gintama*, it's probably not the best anime to start with."
dagreenman18,2012-04-08,Like throwing a toddler in the deep end and yelling “Swim bitch!”
jackcatalyst,2011-03-20,I mean they still put Kill La Kill in there. I wouldn't put that as beginner.
[eliminado],,[removed]
PsychologicWhorefare,2024-03-11,I was going to say the same about great teacher onizuka! The show that starts minute one with a grown man checking out high school girls by looking under their skirts then has an epiphany that if he gets a job as a teacher he can groom a young wife that will still be hot and bangable when he's an old man! Like it's a great show all things considered because he's shitty but has a heart of gold and the balance between him being a well intentioned person that slowly grows to care about his students is the heart of the show but like if you know nothing about anime that's asking a lot of someone for their first experience. That's like saying golden boy is a good beginner friendly anime. Is it hilarious? Yeah. Does that mean beginners are going to accept the MC rubbing himself against freshly used women's toilets and swallowing their spit? Probably not!

Thybro,2012-05-09,Akira is a classic outside of Anime fans. Sure it’s  more palpable when you are able to weed out some tropes. But It’s a recognizable masterpiece and we seem to be talking about beginners to anime not to cinema as a whole.
AntiBomb,2016-06-08,"Akira is one if the biggest anime movies to have been released in theaters, it's what popularized the medium in the west, and proved it wasn't just dumb stuff for kids. I'd say it's good for a beginner. And it doesn't have any weird anime trope, it's just a sci-fi movie which happens to be 2D animated."

it's like a restaurant menu. yes, you can make a menu of 100 different cheeseburgers. think of this more like the cheesecake factory menu, where they have one or two of a lot of kinds of food. most people who have any appetite for anime would enjoy at least one of these. they should start there, and then get into other stuff later."

But then it seemed like all the kids i couldnt stand in middle school were super into DBZ, so i snobbishly avoided that and all the other popular shonen of the time by association, despite being a fucking tokusatsu nerd... But then yeah, *Cowboy Bebop* and *Trigun* on Adult Swim like errybody else."
TeaTimeKoshii,2018-02-07,"This is very true, back then we watched whatever we could because of limited access.

It was cool though in a way, because anime was like that and not at all as mainstream or accessible as now there was a kind of “secret” factor or it felt like contraband or something.

Not like you were doing something bad but it was distinctly culturally different and very much so the opposite of a lot of American cultural values—especially in cartoons."

MrNewVegas123,2018-01-25,I think there's a distinction to be drawn between an anime that is pure fun and an anime that is nothing but fun.

Jaggedmallard26,2012-09-26,Adult Swim. Anything that broadcasted on Adult Swim when broadcast television was still a thing of note (including KlK) is going to have been someones first anime because they were (probably zooted) watching Adult Swim when it came on at 1am and thought it was cool.
Sesemebun,2023-10-24,Hell yeah thanks for the news
frankie_yuki98,2024-07-14,Yeah I was gonna say that generally the most popular sports anime are stereotypically (obviously very generally speaking)masculine-leaning in that they focus on sports that are more popular with men or male-dominant. Whereas personally I didn’t enjoy Haikyuu very much and have no interest in Blue Lock.
wterrt,2023-04-29,"the romance section in this is all pretty bad. except maybe fruits basket (I haven't  seen the remake) 

kaguya is a good show but more comedy than romance until the end. if you go in looking for a romance anime you'll be disappointed for a long time. 

from me to you is... not good. it's incredibly slow and after over 30 episodes they [kimi ni todoke]>!finally confess to each other only to both misunderstand and think the other doesn't *like* like them for another 3 whole episodes, despite **everyone** else knowing. what happens after **3 episodes** - an entire HOUR - of waiting? a ""comedic"" interruption by an annoying side character ruins their private moment that was supposed to fix all this by **asking about snacks**. then **another** 2 episode delay.!< 

there is SO little payoff due to all of this bullshit. the 1.5 episodes at the end is not worth it. 

just absolute garbage, and honestly a perfect example of what was terrible about romance anime in the past."

goodnames679,2012-11-23,"That's fair for sure, but I'm saying SAO deserves a closer look too.

She draws her sword on Kirito just because she fell asleep near him lol

I'm not saying Toradora is a great show for beginners these days, but for very similar reasons I'd say SAO should become less and less of a default pick for beginners. 

There are numerous alternatives in the isekai and isekai-adjacent space these days, depending on the newbie's preferences I'd probably recommend Eminence in Shadow or Isekai Ojisan or Log Horizon."

eP1C_GaMePLaY,2021-11-12,"Sad day for mobile users, this is the longest infographic I've seen lol, just have to usr the spreadsheet.

I immediately went for the 1 star rating sections because my 2 favorites are over there. It seems there's only 5 noticeable heavy decrease in positions by like, 50+ spots: Mushoku Tensei, One Piece, Gintama, 86, Monogatari.

Mushoku Tensei and Monogatari, understandable. 86, you very much so see the divide for the shoe when the name is brought up. But the One Piece and Gintama ones makes it very obvious that there are numerous 1-Star voters that are just haters of shows they've never seen LMAO."
anoctf,2019-02-25,so MHA is the most mid(2/3 stars) show on the list followed by Demon slayer

Individual_Tutor_271,2023-06-14,"If Haruhi Suzumiya, Toradora and SNAFU weren't on there, I would throw a hissy fit. Seems like older the anime is, less popular it is (in general, not all of them). Haruhi is still an institution in Japan (every time I go there, every library or book store has at least couple of light novels, if not all of them, and I am not even talking about posters or characters, especially in Kobe area). SNAFU is almost as prolific, almost annoyingly so."

Heda-of-Aincrad,2022-06-25,"I would have been very curious to see how these scores would change if measured by how many people have an interest or complete lack of interest in them as well. 

When I voted in the poll, I only rated the shows I've seen, and left the ones I avoided because I'm sure I would dislike them unrated - but in a way, that seems like it would skew the scores towards higher ratings, and mainly show that the majority of people interested in the show ended up enjoying it, without taking into account that there may also be a large percentage of people who consider it not worth a watch for them."

It's been amazing to watch each generation of fans shift the listings. What was once the best rated show is now mid-tier on this list.

But it's also bittersweet. Not a single anime released in the 80s is on the list, including Barefoot Gen, Grave of the Fireflies, and Akira, just to name a few.

It may just be because people have never seen them or it's just too easy to forget them when scribbling down some of the best anime ever made.

40 years from now, the list is going to look so much different."

At least in the overall top 100 they are all in the top 50."

KryptisReddit,2019-06-04,I’ve never understood steins gate love. Tbf I’ve never even finished it but every time I try to watch it’s just crude humor and a very unlikeable main character. I want to get into the mystery but I just can’t get past the character. It’s like fire force being completely ruined for me by that lucky lecher girl. Unwatchable.
showstride,2020-08-25,This can’t be the real list? Frieren really?
Othmanizm,2019-10-17,I don't get Fererin. The anime is average at best in my opinion. Fererin is the example I give when I wanna tell people to never trust ratings.
Yoshi444444,2018-05-24,"Fuck, I'll say it:

Frieren is so bland compared to literally any of the other 29 animes in that top 30 that my theory is that it was one of the first non-battle shonen(ironic given its second half) to the majority of the new anime fans, and that's why it gets so many 5 stars (since ""I like this"" equals 5 stars).

In case anyone asks why: The characters are pretty flat (charisma and depth-wise), none of them stand out in anything beyond Himmel who works pretty well, the structure and interactions are repetitive even for an episodic anime, the dialogue also suffers from this, characters repeat the same lines in the most generic way possible and then make a deadpan face. Outside of the very few touching moments between Frieren and Fern, the main trio gets boring very quickly and when they finally add someone who gives it some dynamism, he gets removed after 3 episodes. The second half is an arc you can find in any average battle shonen, and I understand that this is just the introduction of a long-runner that will get better, but for that very reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score, I would save it for when they get to an arc like the Golden Land arc, which is the best of Frieren and where the main trio are not protagonists btw.

I guess that beautiful animation and good direction can really carry anything in the eyes of the mainstream audience, even Keiichiro Saito's direction shined a lot more in Bocchi the Rock. It's good show but far from the perfect masterpiece or best anime of all time that its fans claim it to be."

I_am_YangFuan,2024-03-17,"I drown in Superhero slop on a regular basis and I love cheesy stories (Fairy Tail) but I never managed to finish the first season of MHA. 

I think we are on to something."
grimjowjagurjack,2022-07-28,"Those are capping , last season from MHA was a masterpiece , definitely one of the best shounen"
benoxxxx,2013-03-13,"I'll never understand this take. For me, MHA is the GOAT shonen. The only other contenders are HxH, which IMO has horrible pacing for at least half of the runtime and wayyy too many boring side characters, and JJK, which has better fights but less heart and worse worldbuilding. There's also Mob Psycho - and I could see the argument for it being better written, but I don't prefer it.  Besides that, nothing else comes close in my eyes.

I think people confuse a generic premise with poor writing. MHA is the former, but not the latter. The subtlty of the character development is very rare in the genre, but sadly that goes over a lot of people's heads."
[eliminado],,"I'm up to season 2 and it's perfectly serviceable entertainment I think. I would say it has a lot of heart and character and interesting worldbuilding and characters, and the way powers work is more interesting than your typical what is his power level. That sets it apart from a lot of shonen.


It is pretty juvenile though and honestly I'm already tired of Bakugo growling his way through this series, and don't know why they even keep going with him. Do they? He needed to be locked up from day 1. He's obviously a villain for all his life.


It's a decent enough show to watch though I'm not gonna knock it. Can't hold a candle to the Dungeon Meshis and Evangelions out there, but it's alright."
jackofslayers,2016-10-21,It can be hit or miss since it is a comedy. And it is pretty common for super beloved anime to gain detractors.
michhoffman,2016-06-05,"Probably for a similar reason that One Piece got the 2nd most.  It's super long which can turn people off, and it's fans are quite obsessive about it which can turn off people who like to be contrary."

LiterallyKesha,2012-03-20,I watched it again recently and I don't know...it's good and the characters are the main draw but it didn't feel like a top 3 anime to me. I did watch it when it was airing and it was huge at the time. Maybe it's because it's so character-driven that I may have seen versions of all these characters since its release.
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,Never stops.
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,"A non-trivial percent probably haven't watched some of them, but even if you assume that it's *all* of them the difference isn't *that* big. Mushoku Tensei jumps from #50 to #34 if you remove all of the 1/5 scores, and it's the most extreme outlier in the category. For most anime it's basically just shifting as a result of random noise at that point."
Yamcha17,2017-04-03,"That's what I think for Legend of the Galactic Heroes. I am maybe biased because it's my favourite anime, but I am absolutely certain those one and two star rankings are from people who put them just because it's old. And yes, there are people who will reject just because ""it's old so it's bad"". The reasoning is the same for Gintama."
TheLastTitan77,2023-11-10,"Idk I watched like 20 eps of Gintama and really wanted the refund on all the time I wasted on this. Im usually giving solid amount of eps before dropping stuff especially for longer shounen series but yeah, couldnt handle it anymore. While I wouldnt actually rate it I think many ppl deserve to give it a rating if they were at similar situation to mine (so they gave show a fair chance before dropping it to oblivion)."
Comprehensive_Rule11,2020-09-12,I would say One Piece got similar treatment. A portion of those 1/5 scores are definitely from petty people who haven’t watched it.

And One Piece probably? It's got an abnormally high amount of 1 stars too. I didn't like it and it wasn't for me so I quit it until recently(watched the live action and that got my interest going again) but I wouldn't rate it a damn 1 star just because I didn't like it and dropped it"

fieew,2017-08-25,">Rakugo with the third most 1 stars is also shocking.


I adore the show and think it's brilliant. But there are quite a few reasons people may rate it low. The first few episodes are a slog to get through NGL. They're just pretty bland. It takes up to the end of episode 3 for me to get really invested even on re watches. Moreover, switching main cast members may leave a sour taste in people's mouths. Plus the ending was a bit contentious with the big reveal. So there's quite a few places where people can sour on the show and decide they don't like it. 


Despite, all that I ADORE the show. I love the changing cast and time periods. I love the end. I love everything about the show. It's a fantastic character study of people just being people."
Anshin,2012-03-24,So I've seen it's a sports anime but for a table game right? Does it still carry the same vibe that a sports anime does (hype)? Or is it more like a logical/ thinking anime?

I absolutely abominate any sports anime, but in case it's focused on strategy or something it may actually sound cool"
Zeallfnonex,2019-04-01,"Not surprised in the least, unfortunately: for some reason 86 generates a lot of ""I hated it and thought it was the worst thing ever"" vs the more usual tempered ""I didn't think it was for me"" criticisms. I have no idea why, you'd think A1 insulted their mothers personally with the show for the amount of random vitriol I've seen against it.

(And I do think some criticisms of it are fair, I have my own despite loving it overall, but somehow the haters go past the criticisms and rarely offer any reasoning for WHY they thought it was bad. Anyways.)"
Boumeisha,2020-11-11,"86 isn't at all a subtle story, but a lot of people still seem to walk away from it missing the point and thinking that it's nothing more than ""racism bad"" or *cool, stoic OP protagonist.* Then there's people who like the first cour, but think that the second cour should've been more of that."
DrStein1010,2018-09-27,"A lot of people seem to irrationally hate it for some reason.

And then the fans get pissed, which leads to the haters getting even more vitriolic in response."
Kowairo11,2021-04-24,There is nothing hard to interpret in either 86 or AoT. 86 has its fair share of flaws imo which you will either like or hate on a personal level. I will also assume that most people dropped the show in the beginning since it is the most annoying part of the show and that is why the racism is their only impression of the show. And cour 2 critique also makes sense.

TabbyMicrobe919,2020-10-12,"It’s possible that new watchers after that initial “nobody hates it” sentiment indeed love it because they saw the high ratings and thought “must be one of the best anime ever”. The power of influence from ratings can never be downplayed. Most people see a high rating and are more likely to love a show because of the preconceived notion of it being amazing. Not to say that they aren’t amazing, of course. I just wonder what the most beloved anime would be if ratings and popularity weren’t a thing."
FetchFrosh,2013-03-28,"Yeah, I definitely wasn't expecting it to have quite that strong of a showing in the 5 star camp."
ForsakenLibraries,2022-10-22,"5 stars doesn't mean #1, so it doesn't disprove it. In the [100 favorite poll](https://reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1d8uuqw/ranimes_100_favorite_anime/), there are 12 anime in the top 20 that have a higher % of #1 votes than Frieren. And that's without taking into account that a lot of new anime viewers might have Frieren as their #1 simply because that's likely the best they've seen so far. 

Maybe as time passes, more people will relate to the anime and put it in their #1 spot. After all, S1 only finished airing earlier this year. It's also getting a second season, which will surely help.

That said, I feel like Frieren is that kind of anime that, while it's stunning to look at and its story doesn't have many faults, most people don't resonate with the anime or the characters that strongly. And that's usually why people put an anime as their favorite. But that's just my opinion."
Martel732,2010-08-29,"I have been watching anime for decades and Frieren has climbed pretty comfortably into the top spot for me. I love fantasy as a genre and the depictions of Elves in the manga/show are my favorite. The story does a fantastic job of portraying Frieren, as she has centuries of experience but is still young relative to her kind. Plus, the way that Serie has years of low-level trauma of an ageless being existing among people with a lifespan of flies to her. 

People can say it is recency bias but it is possible to just recognize that you like a story."

Martel732,2010-08-29,"Yeah, I honestly pretty much entirely ignore 1-star reviews as they are just generally people salty that a popular show is better received than the popular show they like. 

If a show has a bunch of 1-star reviews I might still give it a try. If a show has a bunch of 3 and 2-star reviews I will be more skeptical as that was likely reviews by people that actually considered the quality. There is now way to know but I wouldn't be surprised if at least half of 1-star reviews are from people who haven't even watched the show in question."

Time-Ladder4753,2022-03-01,"I think it's also wrong to think that show doesn't deserve to be #1 just because it's recent. 

I loved it and comparing it to some other highly rated shows, I can see that Frieren has less things that average person might dislike, which further boosts its average rating. 

Like AoT having a lot of gore, FMA Brotherhood having alternative version from 2003, or just something like Clannad or Ping Pong having a very unique art style.

It also felt like a great recommendation for people who aren't into an anime, and I think situation with ""Your name"" is similar, where anime fans might prefer some other anime movie, but on average it's one of the most liked ones."

Parzival1999,2018-01-11,"No show is perfect, but I found Frieren to be top tier in animation and music, and the characters and story were phenomenal as well. It is very well made."
Shiroe,2013-10-28,"> Also, is Frieren really that good?

Basically yeah. It's a very high quality production and a top tier adaptation that deftly improved on the few notable weaknesses of an already pretty beloved manga. A year later and it's still rated the highest on the majority of the big anime rating sites which is pretty unprecedented. At this point the only thing likely to dethrone it any time soon is when the 2nd season comes out in a year or two, as long as the 2nd season maintains comparable production quality.

Which isn't to say you'll necessarily like it personally, but it's in that same class something like FMAB is in where the vast majority of people will find something to really like and little to not like."

Check back in 20 years and maybe the WIT version will be more highly praised."
CelestialDrive,2015-03-18,"I'd never give either 1 star, but here's the argument against the troll accusation, from someone who has watched hundreds of episodes of both and does not like them.

The One Piece story is fantasic, the anime for it is nigh unwatchable. Don't point me to One Pace, putting a fanmade bandaid on a bisected corpse is not a solution. Once in Thriller Bark I looked at the progress bar and the recap of the previous episode was lasting eight minutes. The Yokozuna fight in wano made it to air. Don't fucking pretend this anime does not have a massive, core issue killing it from the inside.

I appreciate Gintama, I don't vibe with its sense of humour. Comedies and horror leave and die on the audience's gut response, and Gintama for me has always been ""I can throw it in the background and once every three episodes maybe it'll be funny, for five seconds"". I respect the series, but I get the blowback, even if it's a better adaptation than One Piece is by a mile."

If they did the same with basically all of One Piece it would be much better."

[eliminado],,The pacing? Did you want it to go slower or faster? Some episodes adapted 3 chapters
tmp_advent_of_code,2021-12-04,"It breaks some anime tropes like fan service. The main character is OP yet while it's about her, the secondary cast is a big focus with them growing and learning to shine. SO the main character is more a mentor than anything. It's got some fun time skips. You get to learn about the past and then grow with the secondary characters. And the pacing starts slow and chill and feels more slice of life before working up to more battle anime. I definitely could see the slow start as a turn off for some,  but I really enjoyed the world building and more easy going aspect so that the characters I could get attached to."

Broken_Moon_Studios,2016-06-28,"As someone who likes Mushoku Tensei, I do have to agree that the worst part is EASILY the protagonist.

I get that the point of Rudy being such a dirtbag is to see him grow into a better person, but that argument fails because:

1) He starts at such an unbearably low point, with offenses such as constant sexual harassment and pedophilia (he is a grown adult in a child's body having sex with an underage girl; he really could've waited until he was 18 but chose not to), that it's practically impossible to forgive him.

2) Even after his ""redemption"" he is still a bit of a sleazebag. I personally root for the success of his friends and family, but not for Rudy's. Which is a really bad situation when he is the main character.

Honestly, if there was a version of Mushoku Tensei where Rudy was less of a pervert and more of an asshole, I think the story would be waaaaaaay more popular and generally liked than it currently is."
GezelligPindakaas,2020-10-27,"Funny how for me it's quite the opposite. A flawed protagonist makes it way more interesting that the usual cookie cutter goody two shoes that it's pretty much in 90% of the shows. Even if just for a change.

I do understand though the fact that other people have a problem with that and avoid watching it. My only pet peeve is when people jumps into judgement and converts watching a show into a political/ethical discussion. Enjoying a story doesn't imply supporting the topics the story touches, neither for the author nor the watchers."

Parzivull,2017-03-11,"The bad aspects of his character don't even account for more than 1% of the content so I think it's unfair to judge the show that way. He's consistantly changing as a person through adversity, hardship, pain, loss, achievement, and striving to be someone better. He starts off as someone that even considers himself as garbage, and quickly moves past most of his old behavior except for a few brief moments which the book probably goes into more detail than the show."
doubleaxle,2015-07-27,"Having listened to the books, Rudy mostly becomes a vessel for the story, plot will really kick in end of the third season, Mushoku Tensei is about rudy, but he's just a part of the world's story."
doubleaxle,2015-07-27,"As someone who listened to the audiobook, it's something that never fully goes away, Even after the end of next season where the actual plot of the world will probably get introduced there's always groan worthy lines. 

That's kinda the point though, not gonna spoil but the transformation that Rudy goes through is something that by the end very well done and is a good message, turning from a disgusting, fat, NEET, to a man who just desperately wants to protect his family and would do anything for that.

Granted the novels provide a lot of context, and you don't JUST spend time in Rudy's head, so a lot of it is way more bearable."

LimberGravy,2019-01-15,Because that’s a hilariously baseline comparison that involves zero context
BiggieCheeseLapDog,2023-06-21,Made in Abyss’ content is *heavily* over exaggerated. It does not have anywhere near the amount of stuff that Mushoku Tensei has. I’m a fan of both btw.
pina0ch0,2019-10-03,"Manufactured by who??? People who dont like pedophiles?

Made in Abyss shows horrific and disgusting things and its pretty much up to the watcher to decide what to make of it. MT shows the protagonist (who we know sees himself as an adult man) do clear sexual acts against children and adults who look like children. These acts are portrayed as lighthearted and the protagonist is rewarded with his Harem."

AgentOfACROSS,2021-09-23,I think Mushoku Tensei is just more widely known to people than Made In Abyss or Oshi no Ko so that may have something to do with it.
batmans420,2020-07-05,ONK at least makes an effort to explain it away while for some shows it just feels like a fetish thing
lgnc,2015-03-08,"Made In Abyss is fantastically written though, while Mushoku Tensei is absolute isekai trash

Also, the whole Mushoku Tensei story is a glorification of pedophilia in order to entice the section of the population that enjoys this kind of stuff. Not the case at all of Made in Abyss"
Ichini-san,2016-09-08,">The fact that Made in Abyss doesn't have a similar ratio is crazy to me.

It's generally easier for people to hate on a character than the author. That's why MiA flies under the radar for all those haters. People often think (mistakenly) that a protagonist/character has to be an author self-insert if he behaves in reprehensible or self-serving ways while being morally flawed and not getting externally punished for it.  
  
That's why people shit on Rudeus so much. They can't separate fiction from reality. They don't get that Rudeus' development and ""punishment"" is completely internal. There is no in-universe arbiter of morals and justice who calls him out for being a creep. In fact, almost every significant character in MT is, at the very least, morally grey and does some reprehensible stuff at some point. He has to slowly change to become a better person on his own merits, which is way harder to write and execute since it has to be very slow and gradual while also having him realistically relapse at times.  
  
Hell, this is proven by the insane amount of haters who argue that volume 1 Rudeus and last volume Rudeus are basically the same. They want some kind of preaching character to kick Rudy's teeth in at some point and for him to change after that, but that's just not how life works most of the time. Meaningful change has to come from within. Volume 1 and last volume Rudeus are internally worlds apart from how different they are. If you started reading from the last volume, you would never believe where he was at, mentally, in volume 1.
  
Meanwhile, they are able to separate the author's involvement for MiA a bit too much and a bit too easily. There is no in-universe reason or justification that makes sense as to why we have to see prepubescent characters get tied up naked, defecate, talk about erections etc. You can include such scenes in a tasteful and nonsexual way or just offscreen them as well. I'm not even saying that these scenes can't be meaningful in some way but the reason they are actually presented in the show and the reason why they are presented the way they are is very obviously just because of the authors deranged proclivities, which sucks since the actual story is just really good and engaging."

Velorian,2011-03-13,"I read a chunk of the manga and I couldn't get past the school section.

The author had a lot of really interesting world building going on that I wanted to see more of but the problem was it was really hard to see those parts because of the layer of degeneracy smeared over it.

Like it wasn't even fun degeneracy it just made me feel gross so I decided it wasn't worth the effort and never read it again and by extension never bothered to watch the anime.

I would probably rate it a 2-3 because of the wasted potential."

opalova,2024-03-09,fr its either the most degenerate anime they've ever seen or the greatest iseakai ever made.  I was leaning towards the former after the ep 8 of the first season (mentally 50 y/o man sexually assaulting a 10 y/o is really disgusting and I still cant get over it) but after watching the anime its probably the best isekai i've ever watched as an isekai hater.

yareyare777,2020-05-23,"Yeah like the other comment says, the first half is just establishing characters, it’s like how I felt about first watching Neon Genesis Evangelion. It was hard to get into, but the second half goes hard and that’s why I feel like Steins;Gate and even NGE, are like at the top for me."
REERULES,2019-07-06,"It does get better. But I think if you didn't find the first half enjoyable, you might not like the rest either. The first 12 or so episodes serve the purpose of world building, setting up the events of the latter episodes, and get you familiarised and care for the main cast. So if you found the characters too 'tropey' or annoying, then you wouldn't care much for their struggles later on in the show.

The sci-fi aspect is definitely a very strong point of the story. I believe it does it much better than a lot of media, but in the end, most people who like the show do so for the memorable cast. Kinda like 'came for the sci-fi, stayed for the goofy mad scientist.'

Me personally, I watched it first around 4 years ago, got hooked on the first episode, and ended up binging the whole thing in one night. Since then, I've had like 5 re-watches and read all the VNs. So of course I'd recommend it to anyone who'd listen. But if you didn't like it after giving it a try, then that's okay too. Plenty of other good shows out there!"
TiLT_42,2019-10-18,"As others have mentioned, the show does a heel turn around the halfway mark. Someone once described it roughly like this: ""I disliked the first half, but now that I've watched the second half, I wouldn't have it any other way."" In other words, Steins;Gate takes a long time to get to the point, but once it does, you realize that all that buildup (and even some of the tropes) was completely necessary for the story to work.

Just stick with it. The moment of truth is episode 12. If you're still not interested after that episode, the show isn't for you. However, odds are you'll want to binge the entire rest of the series in one sitting at that point."
Sman67,2020-01-03,"The first 12 episodes are mostly slice-of-life, the last 12 episodes are when stuff goes down and the stakes get higher."
No_Rex,2011-08-24,"> Maybe going against the grain here, but while it's really good, it's also overhyped IMO. I don't think it's the best show either on this chart or MAL by a massive margin like it currently is. Appreciate it for what it is, but don't go in expecting a life-changing masterpiece or you'll probably be let down.

I'll keep enough scepticism to not expect a flawless masterpiece, but this vote (and several other posts) has convinced me that Frieren is more than the seasonal meme generation machine that /r/anime always seems to find, and which turns out to be disappointing when watched."
[eliminado],,I absolutely adore frieren. This comment got me thinking about any potential life changing masterpieces I’ve seen. I’m no critic or artist so I broke it down to animes that have really resonated with me perhaps because I watched them at the right time. Those animes evoked all the right emotions and changed my perspective on things I was dealing with. Frieren was one of those animes and it’s probably my number 1 anime now.
vox35,2009-11-15,"I really enjoyed it. I'm older than most people on r/anime, and I think it's more impactful if you are older, reflecting on your own regrets as you watch it.

tarutaru99,2022-03-07,"Temper your expectations, though. It's not genre-defining or super revolutionary. People sometimes come in with that in mind.It's simple but very polished. I think part of the popularity is a response to the modern anime scene. So much shows out there regurgitate the most generic slop and fail to tackle themes beyond it's most surface level. Frieren actually has thought put behind it's characters and world and it's very refreshing to see. (Yes, it's my favorite too)"
No_Rex,2011-08-24,"> Same tbh, with how often everyone and their mom praises it, I just kinda have to watch it now, don’t I?

muricabitches2002,2018-08-06,"Thanks for sending that page! It's super interesting.

I assume you took the number of top 1 votes and divided by number of top 20 votes, and got that Frieren was #12. Frieren had a rate of 8%, whereas Gintama had an insane rate of 35%. I do think that Gintama's insane rate of 35% does show the flaw in the stat, e.g. the stat is more ""if Gintama is in your top-20, it's likely your #1"" eg many (including me) couldn't really get into the genre. That stat is more a ""If Gintama is a top-20 anime for you, then it's probably your favorite"".

I think the most important question is, if you forced a redditor to watch the entire thing, how likely is it to be their absolute favorite. And I do think Frieren is up there, though other candidates  (including Gintama) are better.

By raw numbers, Frieren does have the 7th most first votes and 3rd most 2nd votes. So, I do think saying ""most don't resonate with the anime or characters that strongly"" is a bit too strong. Plenty of people do gush about it (personally adored it and have it as my #3).

kitsunewarlock,2011-11-01,"""A bit of a sleazebag"" doesn't begin to cover the flaws he has from what I've read about the LN, including ""that chapter"" that was so bad the author had to redact it."
blueman541,2011-11-17,">I get that the point of Rudy being such a dirtbag is to see him grow into a better person, but that argument fails because:

>1) He starts at such an unbearably low point, with offenses such as constant sexual harassment and pedophilia (he is a grown adult in a child's body having sex with an underage girl; he really could've waited until he was 18 but chose not to), that it's practically impossible to forgive him.

>2) Even after his ""redemption"" he is still a bit of a sleazebag. I personally root for the success of his friends and family, but not for Rudy's. Which is a really bad situation when he is the main character.

People are too used to seeing an ideal upstanding hero image or role model. It is uncomfortable seeing a protagonist that isn't. Due to his traumatic event he became a shut in for decades & festered into a scum. He knows it just like many other people in Japan in the similar situation. Author portrayed the more unsightly cracks in society. 

People are also disturbed because it infringes on their own world/cultural/ethical values. Been debated ad nauseam. He is in his 30's but not mentally developed. He is in a different world where 18 is not their version of adult. Then there is the slavery thing. Religious part or ideal concept of partnership etc blah blah endless.   

>Honestly, if there was a version of Mushoku Tensei where Rudy was less of a pervert and more of an asshole, I think the story would be waaaaaaay more popular and generally liked than it currently is.

That is the thing. MT is so well written, rich in world building and character, it stands far from the rest in the isekai genre or anime/LN in general. People yearn for a ""Disneyfied"" version excluding unsavory content they have qualms with. However.... nothing exist on the same realm, that irks people's frustration & illicit more directed hate.   

Well to be fair *Ascendance of Bookworm* does stand next to MT in the same realm of quality. But, it is very PG-rated with barely any ""action"", so it can be rather boring to some or hard to get into."
big-sugoi,2023-05-25,"I love flawed characters, but rudy keeps benefitting from other people rewarding him after he does things that would normally push them away. It doesn't make sense to me. It wouldn't even take many changes for me to like it. Everyone can't help but rotate around him no matter what he does."
Mr-Stuff-Doer,2019-06-16,"Flawed characters are not flawed writing. Subaru is a flawed character, Kiritsugu is a flawed character, the guy from School Days is a flawed character. Rudeus is flawed writing. The only person to criticize a single action he ever takes in S1 is Paul, and he is framed as being in the wrong for doing so. He only criticizes like 2 aspects of Rudy’s fuckin spreadsheet of issues, and the show actively rewards his actions the majority of the time. 

When Subaru lashes out in arrogance, his relationship with Emilia almost ends on the spot, when he pushes others aside in order to take the burden all on himself, they get mad at him. 

Kiritsugu constantly puts aside an ideal life in pursuit of a childish dream he can’t comprehend the outcome of, and his life is ruined for it. 

The School Days MC constantly cheats on women and treats them all as casual flings, disregarding how they actually feel, and his outcome… well, if you know, you know. 

Rudy, a mentally 40+ year old man, fucks a minor, and the show has said minor struggle with herself afterwards because “she’s too weak and it causes his exceptional self to have problems.”

When a flawed character’s flaws are not treated as flaws, it becomes flawed writing."

alslieee,2022-07-12,"I had to take a six month sabbatical after that episode. 

As I've aged I've learned to appreciate the distinction between art that quite frankly feels good, verses art recognizable for its mastery and is remarkable in its own right. 

That's why Das Boot is one of my favorite movies. You don't get captain America holding mjomlnier saying ""avengers, assemble."" You get the stark reality of war. You gain perspective as you feel empathy for the meaningless loss of what you've become attached to, as the bigger picture of every battle and death loses its depersonalization."

RealCakes,2018-08-27,"So if you go on r/sailormoon, you'll find that while people love the anime, they don't typically like the original dub as it changes not only dialogue but large aspects of the show (for instance, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus are made into cousins in the OG dub, whereas they are a gay couple in the manga and sub). 

Thankfully, nowadays, if you want Sailor Moon but don't wanna watch it as we did in the 90s, you can watch Sailor Moon Crystal, which is like a leaner, closer to the manga adaptation. I've heard great things about it."
darkmacgf,2016-10-07,Very inconsistent quality throughout the seasons.
MachKeinDramaLlama,2022-04-02,"I addition to the factors that have already been mentioned, the old anime adaption is full of filler and even in the japanese version the later seasons change a lot of major things compared to the manga. Unless you were a fan of it from back when, there is little reason to watch it nowadays. 

And also you kinda can't, since the network it originally aired on let the tapes degrade over time and didn't bother to color correct them during digitalization, resulting in many episodes having a very dreamy pastel color pallete now. 

The new adaptation is much more faithful, but the animation quality is kinda meh during the first couple of seasons and now people are complaing that the plot is moving too fast for a first time viewer to really get to know the characters.

So even though the original SM anime definitely had a massive impact on me and will always have a special place in my heart, being the first instance of LGBT representation and strong female characters I have consumed in my life, I just would only recommend it to people who are chiefly interested in it just to experience one of the classics."

benoxxxx,2013-03-13,"Demon Slayer is barely above MHA on this list.

And IMO Demon Slayer is wayyyy worse than MHA. Aside from a cool artstyle and moments of great animation it's just so damn boring. All the characters are as basic as it gets, the villains are uninteresting, and it interrupts the action with flashbacks way too much. I'm cool with that when the story is as engaging as the action, but in Demon Slayer the action is the only thing worth sticking around for."
Fearofthe6TH,2024-04-13,"Nah, a good chunk of them if not most certainly watched it, but not all the way through to the end.

SometimesMainSupport,2017-01-16,"[""Start at episode 3""](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/watch_order#wiki_gintama) isn't clear, so it's easy for the first two episodes to miss.

ThespianException,,"Extremely valid point. Different shows (or things in general, really) will resonate with different people differently at different times. That's a big part of the subjectivity of art and something I wish more people understood. Frieren is fantastic IMO, but when people see it's ~0.2 points higher than any other show on MAL, for example, it'll probably get unfair expectations put on it. If someone goes in expecting something that strikes that chord with them just right and it ""just"" ends up being really good, they'll likely be disappointed through no fault of the show's own."
ThespianException,,"Yeah, it happens. I think giving someone a reasonable heads-up so they have a better experience is worth irritating a handful of fans of said work."
Rorcan,2013-05-16,"Agreed! After watching a bunch of middling, trope-heavy anime series over years, Frieren just felt like watching something far more finely crafted than I would have expected. 

It felt like care was put into making it."
Zeallfnonex,2019-04-01,"I truly believe the difference in opinion is whether the viewer has lost, or is in the process of losing, someone close to them. It's the most important thing in the show, looking back and thinking of all the moments you thought were pointless, or wishing that you could have said or done something different than what you had done. How if you knew they were going to pass, you would've paid them more attention, showed them more love, helped them just a little bit more.

It's not a theme that I've seen much, and maybe Frieren doesn't do it perfectly, but sometimes they absolutely nail it emotionally, and that's enough for some people."
philmycracking,2023-05-06,"Ugh, yeah probably if the studio will be consistently animating every season without pulling a No Game No Life move, we might have the best parts animated in several years time. Guess we just need to hold on as season 4 is already confirmed."
michhoffman,2016-06-05,"I wonder how much the filler episodes in the first 2 seasons as well as Kuroko being Kuroko have to do with it.  At its best, Railgun is one of the very top anime, but I can see it being rated lower by some due to consistency issues."

ForsakenLibraries,2022-10-22,"> I assume you took the number of top 1 votes and divided by number of top 20 votes, and got that Frieren was #12. Frieren had a rate of 8%, whereas Gintama had an insane rate of 35%.

I certainly didn't explain it well. I divided #1 votes by total votes, but only looked at the top 20 anime. I didn't know what a good stopping point would be, because as you go down there's less and less votes.

> So, I do think saying ""most don't resonate with the anime or characters that strongly"" is a bit too strong.

Yeah, maybe you're right. Perhaps it's better to say compared to other top contenders. I've seen people that have seen hundreds of anime and after watching Frieren it became their favorite."

Ebo87,2014-08-16,"It's not just popularity but being almost universally beloved, and neither JJK or Demon Slayer can claim that.

Frieren is just an absolute freak show when it comes to just how beloved a show it managed to become in the span of just one year. Seriously, Frieren began airing September 29th 2023, that's 13 months ago. Yet it has been number 1 on MAL for over 11 months now (one of the longest uninterrupted streaks ever on that website) and also number 1 pretty much everywhere else people rate and rank anime. That's actually unprecedented for any anime.

And it's not even that Frieren is everyone's favorite anime of all time or everyone thinks its it should be number 1, it's just that if you ask most people who have seen it if they would put it on their top 10, they will say YES. And that all adds up to this, a show that just managed to connect with people in a way few have before in the history of this medium. Regardless of what you might think yourself of the show, that is not something that can be understated. Believe me, when I keep using the word unprecedented, I am not mincing words here, or trying to overrepresent these achievement.

When you see very high average user scores for shows or movies or things like IMDB or MyAnimeList, it's always a question of how long until it drops and falls in line with everything else. Usually you have a very high score at the beginning because you don't have that many users scoring that thing. As it becomes more popular the number of user scores increases and with that the average also goes down because that's just the reality of it. And sure, Frieren is also going down, of course. But this freakshow of an anime is the first thing ever to be able to sustain a score as high as it's currently holding with as many users scores as it has (over half a million as we speak).

So yes, you could say people really like that show, lol."
scooll5,2014-12-23,"It's the most popular recent r/anime anime. Demon Slayer and JJK were popular here, but not to Freiren's extent. MHA never really had a comparable huge following in this sub."
Not_a_Psyop,2023-04-22,"That’s kind of the point. Frieren experiences everything on a much longer time scale than humans, so the slow pacing is meant to emphasize how long she takes to do anything. Her interactions with humans and their differences in how they perceive time is a major theme. 

It does pick up after the first few episodes though. Give it time."

Crown6,2019-12-10,"Even better, have him be *kind* of perverted at the start, *don’t use it for fanservice*, put a lot of emphasis on it being the result of its isolated upbringing and possibly child trauma, have the first arc of the story be about him learning that his actions have consequences and have him actually learn to be a better person by seeing that he’s actually hurting people.

Then slowly tackle other aspects of his character as the show progresses.

I’ve seen a lot of people defending Rudeus who seem to be genuinely convinced that the idea of a “redemption arc” and character growth are completely novel concepts, and other people simply don’t understand it. While the problem is that in my opinion (and not just mine apparently) MS is simply a *bad* example of these things."
Mr-Stuff-Doer,2019-06-16,"Dude ReZero is one of my favorite works of fiction and I consider School Days like a 9/10, do not tell me that I need shit “sanitized” or something, I need shitty characters not to be rewarded in fiction that tries to be serious. 

Something like Redo of Healer I don’t give a shit about because it’s power fantasy smut and that’s how it views itself. MT treats itself as a real, serious story, then has the MC rape a child and receive zero punishment. There are actual stories that deal with child rape/pedophilia and can have that person as the lead but they don’t fucking glorify him and have nearly every character worship his every action."
GezelligPindakaas,2020-10-27,"The real world is full of people taking decisions that make no sense. Why do people put up with abusive partners or remain silence against injustice? Why do people suffer from self consciousness? Why do people get abandoned by family or friends? Why does scum still succeed and get money, power, influence and things going their way?

The cases you mention feel like they are trying to teach a lesson to the audience. _Don't push people away, your friends are there for you._ As if shitty friends don't exist. And don't get me wrong, I love Re:Zero as well and it's executed exquisitely. But it doesn't invalidate Mushoku's approach.

Not every story arc needs to end with a lesson for the audience. It's fine to be crude every now and then. Nobody tells Rudy about wrongdoings, but he himself acknowledges and suffers from his own demons as the story advances, (even if he doesn't redeem, which again, doesn't need to happen always)."

I think the 2003 version handles some serious topics better than brotherhood and the darker moments have more weight to them, but if you weren't vibing with it or got bored with the slower pacing then definitely try brotherhood.


Also in the 2003 anime the last roughly 1/3rd is made up by bones because the story wasn't complete yet, whereas brotherhood is the definitive version and has a much more ""satisfying"" conclusion"

I left it on this poll as unwatched, because it mostly was, but if there were an option for dropped and/or unlikely to watch ever, I'd have chosen that one instead.

Basically, MT has already filtered out most viewers who'd be highly uncomfortable with Rudeus, so the only ones really continuing and watching are those that are more fine with him, so sequel effect takes place and you end up with higher scores."
sexy_snake_229xXx,2019-12-06,"It’s not necessarily that straight forward, I agree mal is a fine metric to judge general opinion on animes, but that’s only in western and maybe Japanese anime circles, mal it self is very niche outside of them, I have many friends who watch anime who never even heard of the website, most Latinos and middle eastern people who grew up with anime don’t even know you can rate it in specialized anime websites.

That’s why (all of) AOT and one piece with their flaws are the highest and 3rd highest rated anime show on IMDb, because IMDb is mainstream and has mainstream audiences.

Most people who dislike MT are not regular anime watchers, you can call them tourists if you want, but to pretend they don’t exist because mal average reviews say otherwise is short-sited.

to clarify, I’m not saying IMDb is a good metric to rate anime, shield hero with its 2nd and 3rd season is the 4th highest rated isekai there with a rating of 7.8.

And also to clarify, the people who hate MT are a minority, a not big one at that, MHA gets more hate tbh lmao, I just know they aren’t small or niche like what many people make them out to be.

I don't say this for people who just dislike the show, but rather for people who feel the need to speak out every time the show is brought up in a thread and condemn the show for pedophilia and condemn the viewers for pedophilia as well. Obviously this is just a vocal minority of those who dislike the show, but they actually do get support and likes/upvotes depending on the site.  
  
I call it performative because to complain and denigrate the show and its viewers doesn't actually serve any purpose and it doesn't start any conversation or dialogue. It just seems to me like people want to step out and say, ""Yeah, that show you like? It's terrible and pedophilia and disgusting. I am so moral because I *hate* pedophilia content. Now everyone knows that I am not a pedophile and that you are disgusting."" Then everyone pats them on the back and says, ""Good job for not being a pedophile.

Not rating something you haven't watched is sane behavior. The people I'm talking about will go rank S2 1/10 solely because they hate the series' existence.

>I left it on this poll as unwatched

Unless I'm misunderstanding, I assume you mean you didn't rank it a 1 star then. I wouldn't ever group someone like you into the *religious hate* catergory just because you didn't like or couldn't stomach the show."
zodiacv2,2012-01-11,I don't think I would disagree with any of this. I just think that the people who **religiously** hate MT are definitely aware of MAL and defintely not a sufficently quantity to move the needle meaningfully on the score.

Crown6,2019-12-10,"That might be the point of the show, but it’s not the detractors’ point.

Our point is that it doesn’t matter, because the story doesn’t treat his frankly disgusting actions with the severity they require. At most, the story is trying to make you complicit by giving you fanservice, otherwise they simply play SA as a gag (except the one time it’s accidental, wonder why). Rudeus never really has negative consequences for his actions (again, except the one time he didn’t mean to).

It’s not like MS is the first show ever to have an immoral protagonist, it’s not a new idea, but MS is simply not interested in addressing the fact that Rudeus is a sexual predator, at least not throughout all of season 1 (which is more than enough to decide that you hate the anime).

The animation is gorgeous, to worldbuilding is cool. If you can get over the fact that the story never seems interesting in showing the consequences of Rudeus’ actions, then you have a lot of reason to enjoy the show. It’s that simple."

They’re weird little hyenas who want to tear people down. I make a clear delineation between people who find MT gross and uncomfy and those who use it as a tool for a fake moral crusade. I am a bit touchy despite not being super attached to the series overall (2nd season a dramatic downgrade excepting chunks of part 2) because those virtue signalers are one of my big bugbears. Also they give vibes similar to the overly performative male feminists who later turn out to be sex criminals (dunno if anyone remembers Devin Faraci but if you do you know what I’m talking about). As an actual aggressively pro social justice intersectional socialist I hate fake social justice people, and a lot of them pivot to anti-woke when their misdeeds are exposed.

All that aside, I guess what I would say is people are justified in levying criticisms against MT but shouldn’t cast aspersions against people who like it, especially when someone like me enjoys it (while despising its grosser elements and having issues with the author’s moral compass or lack thereof)."

Not sure what was first, really. All of them we're on DVD, Robotech disc was most scratched so I don't remember it's plot in details, while there's no normal dub on my native language of Macross. Samurai 7 surprisingly good and comfortable to rewatch, while Robotech by itself good, it's love leitmotif makes for me rewatching less easy. Vampire Hunter D rewatching rarely but easily, on disc were both Bloodlust and series.

SirPorthos,2015-07-28,"Log Horizon.

Log Horizon S1 was an interesting anime because it explored the meaning of humanity with a setting where people of all ages and self awareness were stuck in a scenario that they had no way out of. It explored the human nature of innovation, exploration, loss, coping with said loss and conducting politics with actual consequences.

S2 was basically exploring what it meant to be a raider in an MMO. Like bro, who the fuck cares? Also, they tease something about multiple servers existing, like different continents of whatnot. Okay.

S3 is about a coup and a hostile takeover. S1 already was pretty politic-y and S2 was all over the place. But S3 was just S1++ minus the mystique of the setting."

jurrayy,2019-02-11,"The definitive answer is A Promised Neverland. I honestly have never seen a more butchered 2nd season. They changed so much for basically no reason at all. They skipped over some of the most important parts which were needed to understand future arcs and the ending. 

The gravest sin tho is skipping all of Goldy Pond. Fans argue that this arc is as good or even better than the first arc (I am the former). Such an amazing arc and plays in majorly with the story as a whole. Without it the whole thing makes absolutely 0 sense. So disappointed with how they handled this anime."

Second season changed too much from the 1st season's happy go lucky atmosphere to just war and the darkness of the human heart etc etc. Went from a really nice humor-ish story into something unrecognizable tbh. But considering how bad this specific genre (cultivation) generally induces brainrot in their novels, this is actually one of the better animations out there, lol.

Still, I rather go to a cozy and heartwarming anime after all of that."

Gintoki---,2022-12-08,"I had this opinion for 10 years until I listened to the second op recently.

it's actually not that bad , the song itself is sweet , but the lack of animation makes it no different than an ending with how calm the song is , while usually we want some hype openings to get into the episode , not sleep , ESPECIALLY after the first opening that is even after 10+ years , it's still a popular opinion that it's the best opening ever."
Apple_The_Bard,2019-03-20,"I agree about Tokyo Ghoul.

But I actually couldn't disagree more about the opening. I prefer the 2nd opening to the 1st, though the 1st is iconic. However, with the 2nd, I just love the chaotic melody and haunting vocals of the song, and find myself listening to it still to this day. The animation was slow and beautiful, no big action pieces. I think it really shifts the tone of the show well. It really highlights the tragedy and journey Ken is going through. It was very unique for an opening, I rate it highly."

DNJ26,2019-10-15,"Nah, s1 was already off plot. If they stuck completely to manga, then it would be 1 of the best, maybe change a few things to make it better."
Humble_Story_4531,2020-10-16,Season 2 was good. Season 3 was less interesting to me because he stopped using Return by Death pretty early on.
bbbbaaaagggg,2022-04-03,Don’t really know why they dropped the one interesting point of the story (Subaru dying a lot)
Golden_Phi,2014-09-29,"Early tech tree is believably achievable, so my suspension of disbelief wasn’t as stretched. Completing those early “road maps” felt much more rewarding too. They were simpler, easier to understand, and it took more effort to get all the things needed to complete them. Now the “road maps” are like “Okay, we need like 10 things in 20 steps to get what we want. We have all the things, we do all these steps in a fast montage, and now we got the final product.” Tech progressions feel less satisfying now."
Naman_Hegde,2016-05-22,"Manga wise, I agree it dips just a bit after season 1, but it's still fantastic until the exact point where the latest season of the anime left off imo.

Quality dips a lot past S1 imo because the production and animation quality falls off hard, majority of shots are just stills and pans.

Change in directors past S2 can really be felt as well. S1-2 definitely had a more surreal feeling, especially since it used that one great ost quite a bit (Stone World). meanwhile S3-4 directing, it felt like shots and scenes were sped past and didn't take their time, more focused on comedy."
Humble_Story_4531,2020-10-16,The Shibuya incident was great. ITs the stuff that will inevitably be in season 3 where the story starts falling.
Legitimate_Artist689,2023-09-08,Nah S2 was goated

HellishWonderland,2019-08-01,"S2 doesn't even feel canon tbh. Like it feels like a fanfiction, then S3 tries to get back in line with the manga albeit only slightly but you're missing everything that happened in the manga during S2 so it feels so messy. Never saw S4 so idk but it's s3 cour 2 technically so I'm fine with not watching it"
Hohenburg,2019-08-23,People always said that and eventually I carved in and read it. It is so much better. Season one added scenes and did little changes which made actual Improvements. The moment he gets out of the Bird Cage it genuinely starts to assassinate Kens character in the Anime.
Dark_Lord4379,2021-07-09,"Season two is kinda cool if you look at it from a non canon fan fiction, I mean Eyepatch Ghoul joking Aogiri Tree goes hard, but it’s in no way even remotely close to the events that season two SHOULD have included."
Tros-tomaat,2021-08-15,The manga is so much better. And i first watched the anime so its not just coming from the manga only people
TheBigMerc,2021-01-17,"Yeah, me too. Shield Hero season one was the first anime to make me want to read the source material. I'll probably still try to catch up to the light novels, but man... It's such a big dip in quality from the season one content."
Awoken1729,2024-03-16,Second season was a slower pace but him taking the lead I  the third season whilst the rest collapsed into total breakdown was such satisfying catharsis after what he went through because of them in season 1. I can't wait for season 4 - it was worth carrying on.
[eliminado],,from revenge story to a generic harem with can-do-nothing-wrong mc.. bleh
TurtlePope2,2025-03-25,People really outting themselves when talking about season 1 being good. The show was literally trash from the getgo.
FoilCladShadows,2016-08-29,just cant live up to the first season
naturegamer123,2024-05-31,Kinda fell off during the giant turtle season
gamiz777,2020-09-20,"The show was carried by the protagonist struggle and the viewers hatred for the villians, then the show moved on from that onto less interesting things"
[eliminado],,"The first season has The hero being summoned as the shield hero.  There are three other heros for sword, spear and bow.  Everybody likes them, but everybody HATES the shield hero. He gets betrayed immediately by someone in the royal family and made a pariah by the entire kingdom on a false accusation by someone who purposely mislead him.

Worse yet, because he's the shield hero, he literally can not fight, only defend. It's a cool revenge story about a guy who can't fight, fighting back in his own way.

Then at the end of season 1, he gets his revenge and then some.

Then season 2 starts and the plot has absolutely no where to go. Remember how he couldn't attack?  That's out the window, now he can cast ultra high level destruction/kill spells.  It got boring incredibly quickly."

chaos_jj_3,2021-02-17,"I've done 'em both. I slightly prefer the 2021 version – I appreciate what they did in 2001, but the story doesn't make much sense without Matamune – but neither version managed to capture the spirit of the first act, which felt more like a character-driven adventure series and less like a tedious fighting spree."
SpiderHack,2014-05-20,"Honestly that was my opinion of it back then too, the original show started off super strong and then it got boring like ep 40 or 50 and I never continued it"
bbbbaaaagggg,2022-04-03,I think people confuse s1 part 2 with season 2. The actual S2 with GGO was good and it’s only criticized because it’s such a big change from S1
Awoken1729,2024-03-16,"Yes, but the other arcs were nice and even I can admit the gun arc gave us a decent ending and Sinon who was a great recurring character."
Brave-Efficiency9625,2021-04-05,I loved season 2!
obiwan54,2013-10-25,"""Everything else"" in this case is likely just the 2nd half of Season 1. People always comment SAO on these kind of posts when they've only seen maybe the first 25 episodes and base their comment on Alfheim which is only 12 of the 96 total episodes the series has."
Nekoma1a,2019-07-20,Ggo and alternatives were nice. The alwhatever that was the latest season never rly got into it.
No_Source6243,2023-10-23,Last season was unironically worth it imo
INDE_Tex,2018-05-05,yeah.....the OVAs were ok but S2 really fell flat. S1 is still one of my favorites though.
SirPorthos,2015-07-28,"It wasn't a ""season"". Idk how to call it what it is. It was like 12 episodes and not much else. Their S3 got disrupted thanks to COVID so they just released what was complete."
dirtyburgler,2024-08-03,The drop off in animation quality was insane though.
[eliminado],,I will not debate you.  But you're wrong.
Hyper_Nova101,2019-08-03,"Sorry but no? That is the most reductive take on opm I have seen. If one punch man was solely about an overpowered protagonist oneshotting all his foes, the series would not be as well regarded as it is. Saitama one punching his foes has always been anticlimactic and that’s the point, it’s not fun to watch a protagonist ALWAYS winning without effort even when he has a clear internal struggle and the series knows this, which is why after the first season, he takes a step back and lets the sidecast develop. Is one punch man a satire on shonen tropes? Yes. But that doesn’t mean it can’t have a competent story and offer an excellent exploration on what it means to be a hero and how to find meaning in life."

Upper-Ad-5962,2023-05-29,WTF? The 2nd season was bad with very very few good moments. But the 3rd season was just trash. The 3rd was so deep in the trash can that I wished I had stopped watching after the first season.
The_Night_Bringer,2022-12-31,"My take with anime is that most of the time it turns to that. Either it starts harem like and gets a kinda good story going after, or has a good story and ends up just being harem like. I don't like harems at all but it's like 99% of fantasy anime, so I'll just bear with it."
Infinite_Worker_7562,2021-05-17,"Yea that’s definitely one of my biggest anime disappointments. I was so hyped coming of season one and when season two came around…trash.

I think what we really needed was something like four seasons of it, with each season following one of the heroes, giving us the same start but showing us a totally different perspective. Letting us follow the other heroes journey and eventual redemption to come together and save the world."
uhgletmepost,2024-03-13,"Incel power fantasy are boring.

DMking,2012-07-14,The other heroes exist just to make Naofumi look good. They were so painfully incompetent
kaotickilee,2012-02-27,"I get it may be in the Manga, but that's not what I mean. It just didn't match the first season in my mind."
SeshiruDsD,2020-11-03,"Wendy is completely different, she was introduced in a solid arc, had plenty of development, and is actually a responsible and relevant character. Her age is not the important part, it’s her use in the story and her character."
FookinFairy,2024-03-28,She is not a toddler/baby
Talk-O-Boy,2018-01-23,"They are genuinely two different stories. The reason Season 2 is called “Route A” is because it’s literally Kaneki making a huge decision he didn’t make in the actual story. He took a different route than the canonical story. Due to that decision,the plots in the manga and the anime heavily diverge after Season 1 

Also, Kaneki is characterized differently in both stories. They changed his personality in Season 02. It’s a lot more one-dimensional than his manga counterpart. 

Tokyo Ghoul RE (the anime) is essentially an abridged version of the manga. You kind of got it, but you skipped A LOT of the details covered in the manga. The anime is basically a summary of the manga (rather than an actual adaptation).

I’m usually not a purist on these types of adaptations, but Tokyo Ghoul’s anime is REALLY different from the manga. The manga is more cohesive and complete."
NaturalCard,2020-06-23,"Do it.

It's about as much better than the first season of the anime as the first season of the anime is better than RE."
Ainz-SamaBanzai41,,Its very different. Even the 1st season is a piss poor adaptation. They cut out tons of content in the 1st season. Entire story arcs were condensed into a single throw away line. The manga is so much better but honestly the last 2 arcs of the manga were rushed to hell and ends in a lame way.
Useful-Boot-7735,2024-05-12,"you are right, I apologise"
-bannedtwice-,2024-09-02,"Ya I've rewatched it a few times, it gets a lot of hate but I genuinely like it. The animation quality can be poor during fight scenes but those scenes are watchable and the story carries it."
ABitOddish,2017-07-03,If i remember the seasons correctly i agree. S1 was Aincraid and Elfwhatever and S2 was GGO and Asuna's friend(?) arc right? If so then yeah IIRC most of the criticism was against the whole cousin subplot and gross villain in the second half of S1.
Silent_Sir3234,2023-03-18,"sure it was a big change, but it was far from bad"
He11Fire_,2022-04-20,Watched through most of it. The latter half of that season was so drawn out i got fed up and quit the show. 10 of those episodes could've easily have been 1 episode the way the anime handled it

Outrageous-Unit1374,2021-08-08,The light novels are actually different! They branch off different stories around season 2 and get further away as they go.

Froent,2017-12-27,"On top of the fights being genuinely entertaining, I liked how it started giving Kirito some personality. It was the season it felt like they were changing Kirito from the generic and bland MC for self insertion to being his own person.

It showed how he still had trauma from the whole SAO incident. It made him face the trauma head on. It also showed that he is clever by solving how Death Gun worked. Stuff like that. GGO was the foundation of giving Kirito a personality, at least to me."

kaotickilee,2012-02-27,Not everyone reads and watches. So if you're just watching an anime with zero outside context. You would be very confused as to where a child fits in after season 1.
Zestyclose_Raise_814,2020-12-14,"There was a tone shift between seasons, which is why it feels like it didn't match"
Ashamed-Bluebird-940,2022-05-14,"Quick aside, and to preface I'm not being facetious when I say this I 100% mean it. I adore the way culture advances references. The origin of the ATLA is that it began as a phrase in 1984, it would jumble around whether Oceania was always at war with east Asia or never at war with them, to represent how easy it was to reprogram the citizens, such as Winston Smith (eventually)

[Sorry for the long text, I adore George Orwell]

I find it genuinely fascinating to see references advance to a point where the references become independent.

I fucking love it when that happens, does anyone have any other examples, I am genuinely interesting in learning more of them"

I heard about that anime randomly and saw it from time to time when I went to search through anime to watch, the MC didn’t look like a character design I’d like and I didn’t think I would enjoy the show.

Here I am now who’s into the entire expanded universe of it (SciAdv), bought multiple visual novels, got a figure, got a manga for it, and even have a jacket and wallet for it.

I actually got into black clover through the manga because I just couldn't bare with Asta's obnoxiously loud voice. I absolutely love the action and Asta's determination to grow strong and be recognised by everyone. And Noelle became one of my favourite female characters in a while.

As for Dandadan, it definitely took me a while to touch it again after reading the first chapter which was wild with Ken literally losing his weiner to a ghost of an old hag and Momo almost getting raped by aliens. Now I'm so hooked and I'm just enjoying all the Momo X Okarun moments.

Overpowered main character: doesn't steal the show everytime, lets the other characters develp, has a great and deep personality

Medieval setting: we actually see society developing with time, as the world is shown throught Frieren's perspective, a 1.000+ years old Elf. It never feels stale, you can perceive the ever-changing enviroment.

The end of the journey: it's the very first episoe. What? Really? But I was shocked jb the way they executed it, makes the anime feel like a chill story for it's first half, while the other half is a whole different adventure, but still doesn't feel like one to Frieren.

Main characters, and even secondary characters: very well written, I love how subtle details keep adding to their personalities, even after they stop showing on-screen. This is the first show that made me leggit believe a character who's been dead for decades is still in the main cast, and still changing the world around him."

I remember seeing one picture of Ryuko back in 2014. Got ""Acting up."" But, it was on my mind to watch it then, I caved in and basically one of my favorite shows. This is coming from a guy who despised Forced in Fanservice. 


Macross, I was introduced it by Delta. Hated Delta by how over the Top candy Eye Moe Designs, and thought Macross as a franchise is basically Delta. Until I Watch DYRl, Plus and Zero. Then Frontier. I changed my mindset. Then gave Delta abit of a try and I stop despising it's existence. It's still Bad and hard to swallow after when you just watch DYRL, Plus and Zero. 


Gundam, I saw the HG Banshee Norn. Love the Design. (Aswell beginning my Hobby of Model kits.) Check the Anime and the Franchise. 

Started to love it because at First, (2015 me) because, its something I wanted from a Mecha/War Anime. As Alot of the time I watch either less focus on the War and Mecha and more cheap fanservice with the MC being either Generic black hair teen/Kirito looking Design. While the Mechs have like, 5 minute total screentime. 

(Keep in mind, this was my mindset 10 years ago. Especially I hated Build Fighters because it's doing what I despised about Animes. But, I don't anymore and it's welcomed. But, not my Cup of tea. Because, I love Gundam because it's doing of what Japan is afraid of doing.)

It was really interesting, they dove into all the symbolism in the show and how the visuals and how some power works is supposed to be like a comment on empowering women and the struggles that come with puberty and womanhood or something. I can't remember exactly what they said but I remember it being really interesting, like I said I'll link it if I can find it.

Edit: I found it. The kill la kill dialogue starts at 29:25 but I recommend watching the entire video. It's very interesting. https://youtu.be/_BGb42JyZDw?t=1765&si=CrvMGb62W-33PSBQ"

Shrubbity_69,2022-01-26,">I remember when it was airing on 4Kids TV under the first dub,

I vaguely remember bits and pieces the 4kids dub, but growing up, I assumed One Piece just a late 90s/early 2000s series and ended with the 4Kids dub.

Boy, was I wrong. I started watching One Piece when a YouTuber I watched became a player in a [One Piece themed](https://youtu.be/1Lt_PbwApks?si=OSVTIDh0TLrzlwih) Dnd campaign. That was also how I started looking into Dnd itself, but that's besides the point."

I think that not having concrete rules as to how the oddities work makes everything feel kind of arbitrary and made up. So far it seems like its good at exploring themes but not good at telling an actual story. Hope this makes sense. Does this change as the series goes on does it stay like this?
ForresttPixie,2024-11-21,"i only watched the anime 😭 the first episode is a little girl riko hanging in bondage naked peeing herself being punished. if I said there was only 4 scenes showing her peeing or defecating I would be wrong since it's higher than that and shows no signs of stopping.


If i am just being honest with myself I would feel ashamed to ever recommend this anime to any of my friends despite liking nanachi and the premise, it's just too bad the pedo author ruined an interesting premise with his gross fetishes involving children."

He grows at a realistic pace, and he grows by making mistakes he pays for in full: physically, emotionally and reputationally. When he gets out of a mess, or grows, it's through the presence and help of much more mature characters around him.

The anime is close to being a masterpiece (for now): it's just really uncomfortable to watch."

also he sticks around for a *while* no shortage of him in part 3"
Filmologic,2019-01-23,"I have no idea what these guys are talking about. Yes, part 3 is the first part that introduces a lot of what JoJo's will later be known for, but if you think part 1 is slow you won't think part 3 is any better. Part 1 is literally only 9 episodes long. It's compact, tells a coherent story, and doesn't have any ""filler"" moments. Part 2 is 16 episodes, but with a much more enjoyable cast, better fights, and concludes everything set up in part 1 whilst setting up things for part 3 onwards. 

Part 3 is 48 episodes long, almost twice as much as the previous two parts combined. It's almost entirely villain of the week too, which becomes the recurring structure going forward; VOTW with an overarching main threat they face off against in the finale episode(s). And I like part 3, but honestly this structure works much better in part 4, which also has a more esthetically pleasing art style and more creative fights and minor antagonists. 

My advice? Just watch it from the beginning. There's no rush, enjoy each part for what they offer differently, and don't skip something just because it's not interesting. If a part doesn't interest you, don't worry, the next one will be different, but finish what you've started first."
Katon-Jo,2024-12-14,That's because they're too busy arguing over which character with twelve minutes of screen time is the strongest.

BeansMcgoober,2024-02-23,"That's why I dropped the series myself. I loved part 1 and 2, but part 3 just dragged on, and Dio didn't really feel like an antagonist. The first two, the big bads would show up and mess with the protagonists. Part 1 Dio was fantastic, part 3 he was as interesting as dirt.

Plus, I think Jotaro was significantly more boring than the previous Jojos."
SecretlyImRetarded,2023-07-20,"Personally I think part 3 is the best part, or at least it's my favorite part, but I think all parts are great in their own ways. People that say parts 1 and 2 are skippable, do they even like the show? They are so important to the story, and I don't see how they could be bad. Sure they might not be the best content the whole series has to offer, but if you can't get through the first 2 parts, I don't see how you could like the rest of the series"
Ch3ru,2015-04-14,"Same, there's definitely shows I'll overlook it because the rest is good enough I really want to keep watching."
Proof-Puzzled,2020-10-07,"I mean, i think Jonathan was far more boring than jotaro, but i agree that jotaro is boring in part 3.

Good news is that later jojo's are far more interesting, specially part 5 jojo (in my opinión at least)."

I actually really recommend it for people who think they don't like Romance/Slice of Life Anime. It moves through its arcs very quickly, and it has just enough trashiness to stay fun while dealing with some serious shit that I haven't seen really explored like this before in Anime, and without really being exploitative (With regard to that central theme).

Some criticize that the MC doesn't change at all, but it's literally just the first season, and his primary function within the narrative is to be an internal monologue. The way the series is handling character development is kind of fundamentally different because the MC isn't really the MC, and the narrative arc of the 3 main characters is nominally identical (Acceptance), and you're essentially just waiting for the moment(s) of revelation that get them there. It's more using the lingering feelings surrounding romance to explore a very narrow slice of life.

Also, I would give 10/10 in all these categories just to the series' [ED2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyckNS-qOcM&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fanitrendz.net%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE) which might be the most visually and emotionally impressive ending sequence to an Anime that I have ever seen. It's impressive on its own, but layered in with that character's arc and a sufficiently contemplative hindsight about how every little thing that happens to you emotionally in your teens feels life-changing and life-defining, and it's a massive gut punch communicated almost entirely visually.

If you've ever lived through how brutal an unrequited or missed chance love in your life, especially in your teens, the show will hit you hard because it's incredibly faithful in how it explores that."

NobleEnsign,2020-05-30,"Imagine stepping into a world where your offbeat gaming skills aren’t just a quirky hobby—they’re your secret weapon for epic adventures. In Shangri-La Frontier, we follow Sunraku, a self-professed “trash game hunter” who’s spent years mastering the most glitch-ridden, clumsy games out there. His unusual background means that when he finally dives into the highly acclaimed VR game of the same name, he’s ready to turn every challenge on its head.

Here’s why it’s worth checking out:

A Fresh Twist on Isekai: Unlike the typical overpowered hero, Sunraku’s journey starts from his love for games that are, frankly, not very good. But that very passion sharpens his instincts, making his rise in the virtual world as surprising as it is thrilling.

Action That Rewards Your Brain: This isn’t about just leveling up by brute force. Battles here are smart and strategic—every fight pushes you to think, plan, and outsmart your opponents in a game where clever tactics make all the difference.

Vivid World, Unforgettable Characters: With dynamic animation and a killer soundtrack, every episode bursts with energy. You’ll meet characters like the mysterious Psyger-0, the determined Arthur Pencilgon, and even a vorpal bunny companion with hidden depths—all of whom add flavor to a richly constructed universe.

A Nod to True Gamers: Whether you’re a hardcore player or just enjoy a good underdog story, the series has a way of making you feel like part of the adventure. It’s packed with subtle gaming references, clever humor, and plenty of surprises that make it feel like it was made just for you.

In a nutshell, Shangri-La Frontier isn’t your typical anime. It’s an exhilarating blend of heartfelt character moments, brainy battle strategies, and a unique take on the gaming world.

\*my words just put together by chatgpt\*"
NoSelf9759,2023-11-15,"I won’t be as in depth as NobleEnsign, but I’ll give my input.


Personally, I loved the first season of SAO. Kirito was someone who felt relatable and acted like anyone who genuinely loved games would: treating the death game seriously and grinding the hell out of it to be the best. 

Sunraku, the main character of Shangri-La frontier, is a million times better than Kirito was in the first season of SAO. His choices are logical, and he plays the game like a true gamer would. It’s not a death game, but he treats it like it is one. He does NOT want to die, nor does he want to lose a fight. 

The game he plays (Shangri-la frontier) is an open world MMO, and he takes full advantage of that fact. Go to the starter town and learn the basics using a tutorial? Who’s stupid enough to do that! No he chooses to fight random mobs in the middle of a forest, and explore! 

Eventually, he finds his way to a mini boss, which is the end of the tutorial he didn’t follow. The thing is, he has absolutely no idea about majority of the game mechanics, nor what is even possible in this game. 

(Side note: this is a vrmmo, similar to the full dive in SAO, but not a death game. So he actively controls his body)

Luckily, he’s used to playing VR games that are so shit, he can’t move the way a normal human would. He’s used to glitches, bugs and the most unfair, obnoxious, and unbeatable trash games in the world. He actively seeks them out, plays them, and beats them. 

So, how will his skills he got from trash games translate to Shangri-La frontier, an S tier game? Will he be able to beat this mini boss or have to go and look at tutorials? 

This is the first friggin episode. There’s a hint of a love story in the show, which is a bonus in my eyes. 

Overall: this show is easily a 10/10- it’s better than majority of shounen anime."
ElPoofy,2019-01-12,"Wow! Sorry just got home after making that comment and I see 2 other people did a pretty darn good job answering this question for me. I'll still give some of my personal input anyways though:

Based on what you said about the show seeming silly: it definitely has it's silly/comedic moments, but the main focus of the show is definitely just on the main character (who's just a high-schooler that's super into hardcore ""trash"" games) progressing in this new big hit VR MMO, Shangri-La Frontier. I also really appreciate how the show also takes the time to sometimes delve into other types of games as well (for example, later on in the show he takes a break from the game and messes around in a buggy, low playerbase fighting game, as well as a mecha battle game, and we also kind of get an idea on what kinds of games he's played in the past and how they've influenced him today). 

  
I think the cast of characters is also very nice! Of course, the focus is on the main character Sunraku, but many of the other side characters get some well-deserved attention, and it never really felt like the kind of show where the main character is the only one that ""matters"". In fact, while I do really like the main character, I'd probably end up saying that my favorite character in the show is one of the other 2 major protagonists, Pencilgon. 

At the end of the day though, the overall show is basically just the adventures of a hardcore gamer & friends in the most popular VRMMO of his time, and kind of how he and his group progress in this in-game universe, as well as occasionally touching on stuff they do outside of the game. My favorite part so far, if you're interested in some more detail, would have to be >! a 3-episode long super-boss fight, where what I would call the 3 main characters duke it out with one of the 7 unique bosses of the game. Not only is the fight itself 3 episodes long, but there's some really cool buildup as well, and from both a ""lore"" perspective and just animation perspective, it was soooooo good! A 3 episode long boss fight probably sounds like a drag, but I was loving every minute of it. !<

Also, this is just my own personal opinion, and I'm not sure if you usually watch shows subbed or dubbed, but I actually found the dub for this show to be both done really well, and very humorously. I watched it subbed first, and then rewatched it with a friend who wanted to watch it dubbed, which I'm usually against, but it was actually really good, and I actually plan on watching it dubbed moving forward. 

Anyways, if you find it interesting and end up giving it a shot, I'd love to hear what you think! Hope you have a good rest of your day :D"

I’m not an anime fanatic, but have seen a few series and movies. This one is never mentioned, but really blew my mind. It was nominated for an Oscar, only for it to be withdrawn because it was already on home video in Japan.

It’s a sci fi rendition of Little Red Riding Hood in a dystopian post WW2 Japan. Definitely the most mature anime I’ve ever seen.

To the ten people who will read this, I urge you to check it out. It really is a lost gem.

[eliminado],,Hunter x Hunter honestly it isn’t even close to me ever since watching that I can’t really watch anything else. Nen is quite simply the best crafted power structure in all anime. The way the darkness of the final arc kinda just creeps up on you the fact that even as I’m watching it I don’t even necessarily think the Chimera Ants are wrong. The depth in the characters it’s just brilliant. I also love how a lot of the fights flat out make sense. Apart from one incident absolutely none of the main characters at any point are considered to be the most powerful Nen users in the show. It also emphasises the importances of stylistic matchups rather than “my blast is superererer than yours”. I could honestly write an essay about how much I love Nen or how honestly every character is very morally grey. They just feel a lot more like real people. Despite being animepowered

[eliminado],,"I've watched close to 500 shows over the years and it's impossible to limit it to just one. In my opinion these are the best anime in their respective genres though:

*Action*

Cowboy Bebop - Not just a fantastic anime, but a fantastic piece of art in general. It's also accessible and is usually the first show I recommend to non-anime fans

*Shounen*

Dragon Ball (1986) - A little dated by today's standards but it had a huge impact on the genre. It really nailed the whole sense of exploration/adventure and was a lot more down to earth than DBZ

*Mystery*

Mushishi - Really unique anime with a lot of philosophical/supernatural elements. Also has a great atmosphere/soundtrack

*Slice of Life*

Aria the Animation series - Severely underrated SOL anime with a heartwarming story and a dose of some great supernatural/mystery elements here and there

*Drama*

Clannad - Not much to say about this one that hasn't already been said over the years. Fantastic drama/romance with some interesting supernatural elements. It doesn't hit it's stride until After Story but you're in for a rollercoaster

*Comedy*

Nichijou - Hilariously off-kilter comedy about a group of schoolgirls who get into trouble. There's a lot of dry humor with some slapstick thrown in for good measure.

*Psychological*

Puella Magi Madoka Magica - Fantastic reversal of the whole magical girl genre. Kind of difficult to explain without giving major spoilers, but it's better to go into it blind

*Horror*

Higurashi - Probably one of the most ambitious horror shows I've ever watched. Can be confusing at first but it features some fantastic psychological horror and was hugely influential on the genre.

Other honorable mentions:

Steins;Gate

Neon Genesis Evangelion

Kino no Tabi

Durarara!!

Fate/Zero

Bakemonogatari

Black Lagoon

mopsroyal1309,2022-03-23,I would pick Erased or Dr. Stone (i know they are pretty Meta). But they are pretty simple concepts. Erased is based on the characters and uses the butterfly paradox very good. And Dr Stone ist just a inhumanly smart guy does crazy stuff in a cool unrealistic scenario and hes only 16.

Another option that fits the same tone is Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You. It's about a guy who marries the girl that saves him from getting hit by a truck in like the first 2 episodes, and the rest of the show is about their life together as a couple. It's also got a nice atmosphere with fun quirky characters, wholesome lovey dovey stuff and a ton of pop culture references."

DrMoneylove,2021-01-04,"By the way if you like this movie I'd definitely recommend checking out Mamoru Oshiis other work!!! He made a lot of great movies however is still not very well known as he is kinda shy. Most of his movies are very philosophical/religious and I guess that's what make them so special.

Please look up his other movies:

Patlabor 2: my favorite  anime of all time. It deals with a fictional Terrorist attack in Tokyo. While it may sound cliche the drawings and music is as perfect as it can be. There's also lots of deep thoughts about justice, betrayal, love and suffering. The movie is hard to get by but some biliotheques have it in stock.
Coup d'etat scene: https://youtu.be/7_Bg4SQvhXU

Ghost in the shell (original movie) - everyone knows it. It's the movie that is as important as Akira and inspired lots of other movies
See video Link in comment below...

Ghost in the shell innocence - follow up which is just as amazing. If you like the original blade runner this is your dystopian follow up movie. 
Trailer: https://youtu.be/LGJ74-dg3cQ

Angels egg - the most avantgarde art anime? Deals with lot of philosophical and religious questions. The drawings are beyond perfect and the concept art is by a famous Japanese artist. Notice this movie is almost without dialogue (amazing!)
Intro: https://youtu.be/M1Bv8UD09ug

Also he did some live movies that are relatively unknown but in my opinion they are just as good!! There's even a movie about people wanting to do a movie - that's meta!
It's called Talking heads: https://youtu.be/AFJHJA67hFc
 
Fun fact: here's a short video of him with an animated dog sweater (https://youtu.be/efyEqlcF1tg)

It reminds me a bit of Babylon 5 where it has some of the best and deepest sci-fi storytelling you'll ever find, but it's pretty dated which turns a lot of people off of it these days.

Also the soundtrack being romantic-era German classical music is just perfect for that type of setting. Giant space battles set to Mahler and Bruckner is basically the coolest thing ever.

Makishima was the reason I really started taking Psycho Pass seriously - usually when shows have a villain like him, they fall into the pitfall of giving them a bunch of bogus 'villain logic' to explain their motivations, and try and trick the audience into thinking that they have a point by having the heroes take it seriously.

But Makishima felt like what all of those were supposed to be - he didn't act completely logically because he was still pretty messed up in the head, but his philosophy on Sybil and society stood up to scrutiny, which was pretty refreshing."

[eliminado],,"Had to smile at this one.

So, my brothers and I hated Christmas with our family (oh yeah buddy, weve got a tale!). They dragged us to the mall every year and forced us to choose gifts for one another. None of us wanted gifts, we wanted the money (about $30 per kid) becuase we were poor and all of us were trying to save in secret so we could move away from our abusive family when we graduated. We tried to get the receipts and put it in the gift box for the other person so they could sneak back, return the item, and pocket the cash. This never worked, though, becuase my parents kept the one, maybe 2, gifts that we managed to get stashed away with the receipts until Christmas. 

Now, before you say, at least your parents got you gifts, please note that they were bastards that stole my mother's life insurance after she died, and were perfectly fine with us going hungry all day at school, which we did often until the school found out. They sucked, and they only marched us to the mall so they could brag to their church buddies about how ""gracious and kind"" they were.

Anyways, my brother's and I decided to try and have fun, so we would hunt for the absolute worst gifts we could find, while also convincing my parents that the gift was perfect. One year I got a string of Christmas lights that smelled like burned rubber when it was plugged in. I loved our secret tradition, we kept it going for years.

Then one year i hand my brother his terrible gift, and he hands me mine. I watch him open his gift, i cant even remember what i gave him, and he gave me a sad smile and said ""thanks, its perfect"". I laughed, and opened my gift and found the DVD box set of The Outlaw Star. He had broken tradition. He gave me the only gift I wanted. After a year of making fun of me for loving the show he had squirreled away enough to buy me the complete box set.... i was stunned.

That was the last gift he gave me. The next year he hung himself across the street from our house. I moved out of my parents home a month after the funeral.

That was a little over 10 years ago. I still have the DVDs, and i keep a laptop that has a DVD player around so i can watch them every so often. I name my Wifi The Outlaw Star. I know it's stupid, but everytime I see it I smile.

ED was love never felt.

It's one of the few films I buy on every new format. I still have VHS, various downloaded VCD rips, DVD, BluRay and 4k uhd bluray.

I rate it up there with 2001, Apocalypse Now, Baraka and Full Metal Jacket as one of the most visually engaging bits of cinema ever.

Separately it's also a fantastic piece of sci fi writing.

Akira is also the reason I never got into anime, because it was the first one I saw (back in the 90s) and everything else I saw after seemed like a pale imitation, so I never bothered with the genre.

I came into anime as a general SF&F fan, and while I love a good time travel story, I'm extremely picky about what makes one good. Steins;Gate met and exceeded all my expectations, even if a few elements were predictable as a genera veteran."
Sporocarp,2014-07-31,"If it's not too late, I strongly suggest NOT following the internet's advice of watching open the missing link and steins;gate 0 before ending the show. To me that seems like horrendous advice that ruins the experience, as it completely ruins the pace of the show and takes a complete detour from the story. One that has way worse pacing. The original series is genius and doesn't need fixing in any shape or form. Watch the original series first and if at all, watch the rest afterwards."

I get stuck on them, just thinking about the characters and environment for far too long.

They don’t have to be long, and it would honestly elevate so many mid shows. Granted, the genre is a large factor too, so a comedy wouldn’t necessarily benefit since plot isn’t the focus."

The nen battles feel like chess matches rather then just slap fights like in other shonen. Even in the less popular arcs, there is always something interesting or really unsettling going on. For example in the coin game with the butler, the idea of it seems kind if stupid like “guess where the coin is or i’ll kill you”. But they way it’s pulled of is really fucking cool, even for a scene that wasn’t really necessary. There is so much detail and effort put into the most minor areas of the plot. On the surface level it looks like a kids show but it goes way deeper than that. It’s gas from start to finish."

chocoboat,,"Despite the fact that everyone knows it, Sailor Moon really is underappreciated. Is it visually impressive? Eh, not especially. Does it have deep and complex storytelling? It has its moments, but other shows do it better.

But it's still one of the all time greats, because of how effectively it makes you care about these characters, enjoy seeing them spend time together, and it really makes you invested in seeing what happens to them.

Like Avengers Endgame, it's not a work of art, it may not deserve to be called the greatest ever... but it really did something special by making so many people love these characters and want to see what happens to them.

I understand the appeal of Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell, Yu Yu Hakusho and other shows that were voted near the top of this thread... but I'd rather rewatch Sailor Moon any day over any of those."

I remember just being like ""wtf, are you sure we watched the right show"", but of course it was back to the mainline story the following episode.

glasseatingfool,2021-12-17,"Inuyasha has a fantastic beginning - one of the best of any cartoons.

I'm sorry to say it gets bogged down quite badly not long after they encounter Naraku - they fight him a great deal, things get very repetitive and he's just not as interesting as any of the other villains. 

Modern Japan, despite time travel being part of the premise (and leading to some very interesting scenes early on), becomes increasingly irrelevant. Perhaps as a result of that, Kagome also stands out a lot less as a character.

There are still good episodes, but they become much sparser."

BasroilII,2019-01-09,"The part where Mob tells Reigen he knows who he truly is, is one of the best moments in the series, and anime, period.

Of course knowing Mob's powers and personality you start to wonder: Was Reigen always a good guy? Did Mob even unconsciously alter he's mentor's personality?  Or was Reigen every bit the sham he is shown often to be, but being around Mob's infectious personality and caring spirit encouraged him to become that good of a man?"
Warskull,2011-09-09,"The animation is big too. 

One Punch Man goes for the very well drawn technical style. Mob Psycho goes for a less realistic and easier to draw style, but then they run with that style to make the character incredibly animated. Its use of mixed styles is incredibly and really sells it. It is arguably some of the best animation out of any Anime."

Not only is he a flawed guy (even more so in his own eyes), the show makes it clear it's also why he doesn't turnout like Sensui (Sensui also really exploits a lot of Yusuke's flaws).

ShallowBasketcase,2011-06-13,"The writer started getting therapy toward the end of the show, which is why the tone changes so much and becomes a lot less “robots fighting monsters” and a lot more “Shinji get in your dead mother and kill your dead mother or I’ll make your dead mother do it!”

An idea that is capable of reproduction and mutation, similar to a Gene, as it spreads from one person's mind to another. By this definition, Memes are highly contagious ideas.

That same applied to Mob even not knowing that he had any special powers. He still was trying to make him feel better about himself. He is just a genuinely good guy who somewhat lost his way being covetous of Mob's power.

It's the first anime that comes to mind when I think ""Best Anime"" & it pretty much just pole vaulted over my previous top 5 (no particular order: Code Geass [no spoilers, have only watched R1/R2 & have been deliberately avoiding movies & sequels cause it was a perfect ending], The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya [& the movie], Persona 4 the Animation & Madoka Magica [& the movie]). 

Anime is usually pretty hit or miss for me, but Violet Evergarden is an anime I'd even show my mother, it's that good & that transitive."
Shopworn_Soul,2013-07-03,"I'm really enjoying watching My Hero Academia with my youngest. It's fine and inventive but oh dear Lord the monologues go on *forever*.

I swear the show could have literally half as many episodes and tell the same story just as effectively.

But it's good for the kid. She's old enough to understand all the concepts but every character just outright stating their every motivation is actually helpful for her.

Edit: except Mineta. He could perhaps state his motivations somewhat less frequently."
OMellito,2015-09-17,">Cowboy Bebop is an anime about characters whose stories are already over.

To me it is a story where the characters live in the past, unable to move foward. There is nothing stopping them moving on but they cannot, and that is why ED leaves, because they can move on."

halla-back_girl,2018-09-11,"Check out Shin Sekai Yori 'From the New World'. It starts as a typical teenybopper kids with telekinesis show then goes HARD into deconstructing that trope. Like Madoka, I really recommend watching it through twice, as there is a lot that doesn't make sense the first time. Many WTF moments. It's amazing."

him999,2012-08-11,Dislike the title but i love the two sentence hook Google gave me. I'm in. You sold me. I am a sucker for this kind of anime. If anyone else has suggestions for animes that will make me sob IM HERE FOR IT. GIVE THEM TO ME. I WANT TO CRY. I don't know why i love heart-wrenching movies and anime. Thank you for the suggestion!

Ruffled_Ferret,2018-11-08,"Rewatching for the third or fourth time now. One thing I never realized: L puts together *way* too quickly some of Light's more paranormal abilities, like exactly that he needs a name and a face, and that a sudden epidemic of heart attacks on horrible people specifically must be caused by a person.

I may be missing something, but to jump immediately to a paranormal conclusion and pin it all on one suspect seems...idk."
antoine-sama,2018-09-11,"I liked the beginning part the most, >!it was the most tense before Light turned himself in, I liked him threading the needle everytime he was in L's presence. Also, Ryuk is a lot less menacing and more adorable of a character than i thought he would be. I thought he would carry out the killing (I had little prior knowledge before watching it for the first time)!<"

-Well built and interesting world

-Fleshed out characters

-Actually interesting filler plot

-The characters actually grow slightly from each experience, and don't pass around an ""Idiot Ball""

So, it just takes significant work to get a filler plot to be good"

superblobby,2015-03-23,"I, unfortunately, don’t watch anime as often as I used to. But without fail, every Sunday, I’d watch Attack on Titan. It is one of the greatest pieces of media I’ve ever watched. It surpasses many tv shows in quality and writing by a long shot!

I quite literally grew up alongside this anime, and when the final part of the final season returns, I will watch it religiously"

chasin_waterfarts,2013-05-19,"It reminds of me Twin Peaks as well, but not for the same reasons. I find both series begin as relatively normal entries in their respective genres, and just get weirder and weirder as they progress. They both end their original runs with movies that are batshit insane and incredibly dark. And of course, they're both great!"

Deruta,2012-07-24,"It was him, and the jazz selections are ___excellent___.  The show is too, but the man knows his music.

It’s called Kids on the Slope for anyone intrigued: It’s a messy, heartfelt coming-of-age story in 60’s Japan (which is a super cool setting, especially watching as an American) based around a pair of teenage musicians and the extremely new jazz scene at the time."
baccus83,2010-06-03,"It’s a thing with anime. Like there’s often the same amount of dialog as in a manga. Like it’s literally just a motion comic book.

Anime like Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo seem to embrace a more film style of storytelling."

InfernoVulpix,2014-07-28,"To be a little more specific, Lelouch of the Resurrection is a Code Geass movie that's set after the *movie* canon.  The movie canon is a series of three movies that cover the events of the show in movie format instead of TV format.

I didn't watch the recap movies, but they change a few things.  A character survives who died in the TV show and the big question of the ending has a clear answer rather than being left ambiguous.

Strictly speaking the continuity of the core anime is unchanged, but Lelouch of the Resurrection is presenting itself in many respects as a sequel to Code Geass.  It's good imo, but not as good as the original show."
kaptainkeel,2009-12-23,"Title:

Code Geass: Fukkatsu No Lelouch

English: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection

It's good in the sense that it's certainly worth watching. I don't think I'd call it as good as the regular series, though. Then again, it's hard to be as good as the series when it's a single movie, particularly when the series is one of the top."
