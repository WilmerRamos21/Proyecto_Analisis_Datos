gentilet,2019-05-25,"Both are devices in which comparisons are made between two things by analogy. The key differences are that allegories are extended and often implied rather than directly stated, and are thus left to the reader to interpret (for example: in an allegory where a lion is meant to represent courage, the author will not ever come and say ‚ÄúThe lion is courage itself,‚Äù which would be a direct metaphor). 

In the case of interpreting an event that no one has ‚Äúauthored‚Äù as either an allegory or metaphor, it generally makes more sense to describe it as a metaphor‚Äîbut the person making the comparison to something else would be the one who is creating or ‚Äúauthoring‚Äù the metaphor. It‚Äôs a stretch to say, in this case, that the fire is a ‚Äúsystem of symbols.‚Äù In what sense? You‚Äôre interpreting it a certain way in order to reconfigure it as a symbol.

actuallyapossom,2024-02-14,"Yeah being in a panicked festival crowd is absolutely traumatizing.

I was at a hip-hop festival in MN called SoundSet (90 degree heat, stoned all day) with my girlfriend, and we had just reached about three people back from the fence at the stage. The last act of the day, Lupe Fiasco, comes out and says there's a tornado warning and we need to evacuate immediately.

Adrenaline took over when we looked at the thousands of people behind us. I don't even remember thinking about it but I told my girlfriend we're jumping the fence and going around the stage to the parking lot directly behind it. It worked out perfectly somehow, we were leaving the lot in our car and behind us a stampede of people were storming the area we had just been parked in.

In hindsight the experience resulted in me never feeling comfortable being intoxicated in public again. This was the first place I saw Kendrick Lamar and I think about it every time his name comes up. Which is really frequently lmao.",0.11363636363636363,Positivo

I dragged my boyfriend at the time out of the emergency exit doors on some empty side of the building - we got out and there's ust a dozen surprised cops urging us to get away from the theater.¬†


Virtually everyone else went the long way through the halls and out the main entrance. I guess he doubled back to exit out of the showing room's direct exit doors, but I think about everyone shuffling along that path, not really understanding how serious the emergency was, all the time.

It is how it works for attendance counts at major events. They count every visitor-day combo. If you attend for 3 days, the attendance count will count you thrice, not once.

That's how for example  the Formula 1 Silverstone GP has a 500.000+ attendance. Vegas EDC has 175.000 capacity √ó 3 days =525.000 attendees. Even though some of those attendees are counted double.

Right, a marketing technique, that's why they do it. It's becoming normalised because it's how many festivals often do it and they don't get called out for it but it is not how you count people/attendees

It's like claiming the city of Jericho has had an attendance greater than the population of the earth because it's been populated continuously since 9000BC and has had a population of at least 2k the whole time so quick maffs, nearly 9 billion people live there!

The the lead insurer takes up the bulk with 25-40% and smaller ones take 7-12% depending on the risk they are willing to accept.

[eliminado],,"What the fuck.  I've dreamed this exact scene.  

I had a dream about a future world.  Buildings were ""plugged"" into the ground like a power grid, gaining their power from tesla-esque currents.  They could hover and assume new positions in the city; plugging into new sources of power.  A virus corrupted the world's server.  I left my house and houses began exploding.  Building, skyscrapers, plummeted to the ground and exploded.  My father went missing and through my journey of discovery into what was happeneng I kept coming across my father from a distance (giggity), but never able to speak to him.  I would see him as I arrived at a train and the doors shut (think gman from Half-Life).

The final scene of my dream is this poster.  Society had evacuated the city.  Everyone was in a cornfield looking back on the hovering skyscrapers climbing into the sky.  They fell into the earth drilling deep into the earths crust and a tidal wave of molten lava grew and began to crash towards the field.  Everyone fled.  The lava was closer.  I could feel it burning my skin.  I looked back, it was 100 yards away.  I turned and stared as it engulfed me.  Then I woke up.

Anyway.  Spooky how accurately this poster describes what I saw in my dream.  I mean, it is exactly the same.  Exactly.",0.015307486631016044,Positivo

REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,2011-09-13,"So cool story about this movie: My wife and I were on our honeymoon in Eluthera, Bahamas in Nov of 2013. We met a couple of Canadian brothers who we went to the local ""celebrity"" bar with, and there we met George Clooney, Hugh Laurie and Brad Bird ‚Äì all of whom where filming ""Tomorrowland"" there.  

It was interesting. This place, called Tippy's, is *the* bar where every celebrity goes for dinner (at some point) when they are on the island of Eluthera. It was featured in the New Yorker, or some other well-read magazine, and the food is great. We went and it happened that the aforementioned trio was there ‚Äì¬†along with crew - filming this movie. Our new Cannuck friends were pretty hip to the local scene, warning us not to take any photos, pointing out that the local Tippy's scene is sacred there, so we weren't to do anything overtly over the top. So what do they do? They order a round of Patron shots for all of the movie people! They told a bar tender to bring a bottle of Patron, glasses for everyone. They announced that we were celebrating out honeymoon, and the drinks were to commemorate that. Everyone took a shot. Clooney wasn't feeling it.  

The second George Clooney realized (paraphrasing) ""people recognize me, oh no, fuck this place!"" he laid $200 on the table and got up and left. It was like he just couldn't handle it. We weren't in his face, asking him questions ‚Äì we were all just standing around. But he left. Right when the band was about to get good.  

Hugh Laurie, with a long head of hair with a balding spot, stayed and hung out and watched the band play. He was a really awesome dude with whom I spoke for a few minutes, mentioning his music and role of House and how much I appreciated his talents. He was just really chill and appreciative.  

My wife was enamored with Brad Bird, repeatedly saying that he was a genius. I'd honestly never heard of him, but animation/Disney isn't my thing.  

So I'm actually really excited to see this movie to relive that memory of being there and meeting them. I know at one point Clooney joked to us that he and Hugh ""wrestled on the beach that day,"" so it sounds like there are some fight scenes with him and Laurie as the ""bad guy.""  

TL:DR: my wife and I were on our honeymoon in the Bahamas while they were filming this movie, and we met Clooney, Laurie and Bird.",0.16637291280148422,Positivo

Bakoro,2012-04-13,"There was an NPR interview with Lindelof that really helped me articulate why I hate him.

In the interview Lindelof talked about how when he was a kid he read ""Encyclopedia Brown"" books, but instead of reading the story and figuring out the mystery, he would skip to the back and find out the answer to the mystery. Lindelof's dad felt that was cheating so he tore the last page out of the books when he got them and never gave them back‚Äî forcing Lindelof to come to his own conclusions about what happened while never getting the actual answer.

So what Lindelof has been doing is recreating his trauma on a scale 100000x larger and then asks people to pay to subject themselves to it. 

That by itself isn't so bad, not every story needs to be wrapped up in a nice, neat, easily consumable package. It's okay to leave *some* unanswered questions. That's not what Lindelof does though. What he does is build up a decent mystery/story, and then adds, and adds, and at the point where there should be some kind of payout, he flips 90 degrees and goes in some other direction, and you never get a coherent piece of entertainment.

Lindelof isn't *totally* shit at what he does, obviously he has enough talent to have gotten where he is, but seriously, everything he's done has ended up being massively unsatisfying bullshit.

Also he's a goddamned liar. With *Lost* he swore that there was a direction and that the writers weren't just making shit up as they went along, and he said there would be a solid ending. As it turns out, *Lost* was supposed to have ended way earlier than it did and the writers were just making a bunch of unrelated shit up after they ran out of the initial material, and most of everything that happened in the show meant nothing.  

Life is already an long list of unanswered questions and letdowns, I don't need to waste my time on something that I know won't have any kind of resolution or payoff.",0.04765625000000001,Positivo

But then the last season came along, took a shit on all 6 seasons before it, and literally made me think ""man, it's like all of that emotion I'd invested into the series was for nothing."" Lindelof (moreso than Abrahms) kept saying for years that he had a bible for the show, that they weren't [spoiler](/s ""dead""), and yet we got the ending we did.

Then he wrote Cowboys and Aliens, which was utterly forgettable.  Followed that up with Prometheus which had the dumbest characters in a sci-fi movie in years (check out Red Letter Media's segment on this movie, it's great).  Then he went on to make Into Darkness which was far inferior to Star Trek 2009.

World War Z was another disappointment that was quite derivative and forgettable.  I didn't bother watching ""The Leftovers,"" but from what I heard from people who did watch it, it basically had the same problem as LOST where it was trying to be all mysterious but just kept muddying itself up with more mystery that wasn't going anywhere.

Saying your story has a direction being worked towards could mean you have an overall concept you are working towards. I guarantee the bulk of shows do not have the entire story planned out (maybe in concept and overall ideas, but not episode to episode or season to season). I agree with the rest of your post about Lindelof but would add most of his writing was a collaborative affair and some of best episodes of LOST were written by him and The Leftovers isn't that bad.

I think big studios should keep taking a chance on original movies, but they should just be more careful with them and actually make good movies. They should stop complaining about terrible original movies that flop and just make good ones that audiences will actually want to see and enjoy.

Edit: I realize that filmmakers can't just snap their fingers and make a good movie. I just think that Hollywood shouldn't give up on original movies because a few bad ones flopped. They should look at those and say ""yeah those flopped because they weren't done properly, let's try to do better next time"" instead of saying ""audiences just hate original movies and we can do nothing about it"".",0.14886363636363634,Positivo

""There's a reason you're seeing more sequels, prequels and known properties because you never know how films like Tomorrowland or Jupiter Ascending are going to turn out,"" says Handler.  
  
Sequels and prequels have their place. Certainly, but at least personally I can only stomach so many of them. One exception seems to be the Marvel movies, because they're just silly entertainment with a very silly (but good) IP. Everything else? Meh...Can't waaaait for another Pirate's of the Carribbean. There's just so much Jack Sparrow you can handle before it gets boring. If you'Re too afraid to take risks and make the movies that film makers want to produce then sooner or later you'll fail I say (or hope).  
  
It's a very dangerous statement and once again those insane figures (especially for marketing) make you realize just what ""Hollywood"" is...a giant cash mashine. The studios do not care about the movies they produce as long as it nets them much moolah. Just doooon't take any risks and make every movie as generic as possible, just to not offend anyone and cater to the masses. Movies that are just for certain audiences seem to fade away more and more. Instead most new movies in a year just blend into one another. One notable exception this year was Bird Man. The rest? There were some good movies, no doubt, but nothing that really stands out. Age of Ultron was good, yes, Mad Max was great. Apart from that I didn't even bother going to the movies much this year.

djc6535,2010-07-14,"> but they should just be more careful with them and actually make good movies.

The studios know the difference between good movies and bad movies *once they're made*, but getting there... that's a lot more difficult.  

It's like the rival exec said, when someone like Brad Bird comes to you with an original idea and has George Clooney on board you take the swing. 

Nobody goes into a movie planning to make a poor one.  The problem is at a certain point you've got what you've got, and original movies are more likely to suffer when they *are* bad.  

It's always a risk that your movie turns out bad.  But if that movie is a sequel to a popular franchise or a nostalgia throwback it doesn't matter if it's good or bad, you'll make your money back.  Original movies don't get that same leeway.  

If the next Bond movie is terrible it'll still make big money, I guarantee it.  But a new property with nothing compelling people to the theaters except its own marketing and story?  That's another story.  It has to stand on its own.  

They **know** audiences don't hate original movies.  These aren't stupid people, they saw what happened when The Matrix hit the scene.  But they know that ""Trying to do better next time"" is not necessarily going to give them a better movie.  It's in inexact science and even if you line up a well respected writer, an fabulous director, and a Grade A star you can wind up with a junker that you can't sell.",0.06893646893646896,Positivo

It's the same in the games industry, the same with professional software. It's iterative.

LikeALincolnLog42,2013-02-21,"IMHO, it's not a story about a kid going on an adventure, it's a story about optimism versus cynicism; optimism and taking action instead of being a cynic that doesn't take action. It's not about a place, it's about a philosophy or an ideal of ideas, taking action, and optimism.  

Take the title for example. In the 1950s, if someone said there was a place named  ""Tomorrowland"", it would conjure up ideas of a fanciful and idyllic place. That embodies the optimism for the future that seemed plentiful in the 50s. Today, if someone were to call a place ""Tomorrowland,"" it would be taken as being cynical and ironic. That embodies the cynical, apathetic and doomsday/apocalyptic attitude there seems to be so much of that the world is ending and there's nothing we can do about it such as in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", where you have to accept the nuclear apocalypse as reality to understand and enjoy the film. 

I take ""Tomorrowland"" as a sincere and personal film from Brad Bird with a modest message of the saving grace of optimism and taking action. To say that it is an adventure film is to miss the point of it, I think.  ""Tomorrowland"" is not about an adventure to a *place*, of wonder, it's about the wondrous, nebulous *ideal* sought by the philosophy of ""ideas, taking action and optimism.""",0.10416666666666669,Positivo

Matters made worse by the fact you cannot re-enter the park with a ticket, so you are stuck with those food options for the day.

Disney parks tend to charge a lot for general admission at the door but they don't rob you too much. Once you are in the gate, you pay maybe a few bucks more than you normally would for anything but you can probably subsist on a $10 turkey leg without eating anything else for the rest of the day.

The nonlinear nature of the story disguises some pretty bad storytelling while delivering some really great characters.

I honestly like how Lindelof even called him out on it after he heard Martin was bad talking LOST a lot during his press tour.

Lindelof twitter quote in response to Martin:

>‚ÄúIn related news, my therapist just hit the jackpot  ‚Ä¶ George? You got yourself a feud, motherf‚Äìker ‚Ä¶ Winter IS coming, bitch ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt take issue with his opinion, I take issue with the fact that he coined ‚ÄúPulling a LOST‚Äù as empirically ‚Äúf‚Äìking up the ending‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve just been informed George is working on his feud response.

It wants its web design back ‚Ä¶ I stand by the ending of the show and defend it accordingly. Until I am worthy of the New Yorker, this is the platform I‚Äôve got.‚Äù

I'll admit Lindelof came off a bit dickish, but apparently Martin was bashing LOST a lot to the press, which is a dick thing to do as well when he hasn't even achieved an ending himself yet and is still purely riding his HBO wave.

Also, I really dislike it when people compare Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones ,or anything really, to LOST.  Breaking Bad was a simple, realistic character study show with a small cast.  It was perfection for what it intended to be and ended super simple like expected.  Game of Thrones is a fantasy epic with a large cast.  Pretty simple, but excellent.  LOST was on a whole other level of storytelling.  Metaphysics, sci-fi, multiple timelines, a large cast, mind-fuck mysteries and twists, multiple character developments, and a bunch more.

To some, LOST had a bunch of ""unanswered"" questions, but many these of the questions were minor and actually answered, but these people were already stubborn LOST haters and weren't interested in hearing any logical explanations or thinking on their own.

Big questions like, ""What was the island really?"" were obviously not explained for the better in my opinion.  I liked how LOST left the island's all powerful mysteriousness intact.  A sort of mystical feel about it.  But on the other hand I can totally understand why it bugs some people.

Lost actually *did* answer almost all of its mysteries, and wrapped up its mythology.

The thing is, the mysteries were slowly answered over the course of the entire show, as opposed to one, easy info dump/twist at the end, which is what most people were expecting.

In fact, some mysteries were answered so satisfactorily, that most people forget they were mysteries in the first place (What's in the hatch?  What crime did Kate commit?  How did Locke end up in a wheelchair?  Why are there polar bears on the Island?  Who was the French woman in the transmission?  Why doesn't Richard age?, etc, etc.)",0.21183712121212117,Positivo

Kytescall,2011-03-19,">In fact, some mysteries were answered so satisfactorily ...

I stopped following the show after season 2 when it became pretty obvious that they were just making it all up as they went along. I checked back in later to read up on the answers to the mysteries and it just seemed like a load of weak nonsense to me. 

I mean, you mentioned polar bears so I just looked that up. They were brought to the island because they had ""keen memory and adaptivity instincts""? Is that true about polar bears or did they make that up as a convenient way to explain their presence? Because there are a lot of other animals that are a lot easier to acquire and train that have those attributes. I would have gone with crows.

Here's what really happened: they introduced polar bears for the sake of making things weird. Easy mystery. Then they concocted some contrived explanation after the fact.

It's the way with every major mystery in Lost, so far as I can tell. They didn't come up with a scenario first and unveiled clues bit by bit. They came up with random clues first and then poorly tried to explain them or connect them together afterwards.

The most tantalizing mystery that stuck with me was one character's comment from the pilot episode - that the monster's noise was familiar, somehow. That's fascinating. Where would you have heard that, and what does that say about the nature and origin of the monster? Answer: Nothing whatsoever. The sound is familiar because they used the sound from a NY taxi cab cash machine in the sound design. It's just an incredibly cheap and lazy way to invoke an ""oooh, mystery"" reaction from the audience.

If you are going to have pyrotechnics onsite, why not build the structure with something that doesn't burn itself down so rapidly?

I am not sure what they built the structure with, but that structure is half-engulfed already, and there are only two obvious fire trucks on scene, with others surely enroute, but they wouldn't make any difference in quenching the flames once they got there given how fast this structure is burning and how high the flames are. That's a very hot fire, and if there were other valuable structures behind what we see on screen that were in danger due to the wind blowing the flames in the direction the smoke is going, the best tactic would be to focus your water supply on saving any structures behind it from igniting. If nothing was behind it, sure you could throw all the water on what is burning (and not yet burning) all you want, but you aren't going to save anything of that structure, regardless of how many pumpers and hose lines you had connected to the cities water mains.

Not sure what the slight +/- 5 knot wind was blowing the fire towards behind what we see in this video but hopefully it wasn't other structures.

99% of venues or event organizers would require the stage to be either made from fire proof materials, either inherently so - like metal and some plastics), or be fire-treated on site. That means getting a company in to spray the entire set (sometimes it takes multiple treatments) before allowing a pyro test.

They might have used polystyrene in the set, my  venue banned it because if it catches fire the inside the burn for a while without any obvious sign on the outside and then it suddenly bursts into flames. The smoke is also very toxic.

sarnian-missy,2019-02-10,"If they're to the point of testing pyrotechnics, 80-90% of their equipment was on or near that stage. Not a single piece of that is usable right now.

My experience may be misled by the way my community events hire equipment, but if the staging is all sourced from the local vicinity, finding companies with a big enough stock, that isn't hours and hours away, is going to be difficult. 

There isn't time, and there isn't  manpower. The crew are now physically and mentally exhausted, so you would need fresh crew, and those crew need to be of the same quality. You can't have amateurs building something that size. 

You can't put lights up until the truss is built, you can't programme lights until they're in place and connected, the same with testing amps and mics without the speakers being in place which also requires the truss and stage to be built. The stage and truss can be built separately and then moved into place, but if you've ever tried levelling a stage in a field, you will know it can be an absolute dick of a job. Remember, this is now on a backup site, which may be levelled differently, so you can't necessarily use the same measurements as the other one. 

The (now probably melted) lighting and sound desks would most likely have been pre-programmed according to the planned rig. That programming will easily be available to put onto a new desk, but it's been set up for specific equipment for it to control.  


Raiding the garden centres for fairy lights, throwing up some LED wall and a few parkans, adding some speakers hauled onto site by every guitarist in the vicinity and plugging them into a desk owned by some amateur DJ who lives round the corner isn't really going to cut it for a festival that size. 


Even building a simple stage half that size would be pushing it if everything was accessible right now, and that's without all the fanfare of that incredible structure they'd originally built. It's impossible to recreate that in a few hours. 

I know this all sounds incredibly negative, but I work in this industry and I'm being realistic.  I'm incredibly sympathetic to the devastation the whole production crew must be feeling right now, and I would love it to be possible for them to be able to pull something together.",0.08459428168730494,Positivo

you also have stuff like [Defqon 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NHgoRQDUH0) (and had stuff like [Qlimax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43TJW0E31VM) rip) which is festivals that have a harder sound compared to the mainstream EDM artists so for us harder EDM fans Tomorrowland's job is kind of like an ""intro"" to EDM that we can throw normies into, not too scary but still EDM to hopefully funnel them into harder stuff",0.01071428571428572,Positivo

I was actually there and still remember how I said ""this feels badly planned"" as we were walking in. I also remember how the place was filling up to a point where it got uncomfortable, but they wouldn't let anyone out anymore. In hindsight I know why. They didn't get the entrance cleared. Although they had an emergency exit over the Autobahn, which I even overheard them talking about. But they never made any use of it. It was weird walking out at the end stepping over what I now presume to have been dead bodies.

If they do not have TOTAL smoking ban at the time when these things are ""loaded"" or ""charged"" things will happen. If the stage is an all steel construction any kind of thunder lightning strike will be warded off by the faraday cage principle. However, any pyrotechnics OUTSIDE that faraday cage will ignite. As well as curtains, foam walls etc.

Whatever happened, the security wasn't any good, and the insurance company/companies will have some objections to it all.

blindmediaproduction,2019-07-13,"And that's only Deco/Build. Think about all the technical departments and their materials like hundreds of Lights, hundreds of Speakers, hundreds of m¬≤ of LED, many SFX/Pyro Devices, Broadcast/Cameras, kilometres of cabling, Backbone/Network, Power Supply, thousands of tons of Staging.

I would say this is material and workforce worth a higher 8 digit sum of money gone to dust. At least 10 technical companies lost a small to big amount of their companies worth in that fire. Think about the materials already being reserved/booked for other events in the next weeks/months. Some upcoming events/festivals will have to redisposition some of their needed material.",0.05625,Positivo
Area69_222,2023-11-14,"So, what's your point?, what does this have to do with the original post?, the Rammstein stage is tiny af compared to a Main stage of a big edm festival, is basically the same stage everywhere (while edm festivals change every year), an edm festival is a one time thing while a Rammstein show is not, and btw, idk why some ppl fail to understand the concept of scale",0.006944444444444438,Positivo

[eliminado],,It's not unfeasible that they could reconstruct a very basic replacement for the main stage in this time if they happen to have a backup plan or a company can provide the stage equipment.

jjoey196,2024-03-01,True true. They have space behind all the vip lounges where the food court is and could potentially move the food court but that would for sure not fit the amount of mainstage ppl so that would be a safety hazard and then im not sure about sound design of the festival and ofc rerouting everything and taking down the foodcourt and building it somewhere else wont be possible in 2 days thats for sure,0.09949494949494948,Positivo

Then again tickets most likely will be covered by tomorrowland in case they cancel it (most likely a ticket for next year will be given out).

In case of flights only if you are lucky in case you are unlucky you will be screwed, and a lot. 
You are in belgium and expect to get a hotel in Brussel or Antwerp? Good luck most will hike their prices and or be fully booked as there will be a very high demand for hotel rooms from internationals.",0.2673939393939394,Positivo
