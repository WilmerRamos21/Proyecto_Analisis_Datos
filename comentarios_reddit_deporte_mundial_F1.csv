Firefox72,2013-08-22,"I'm extremly whelmed.

These cars are some proper trash lmao. 

Nobody can overtake even with DRS. Being just 4 tenths behind at La Source is only maybe enough for an attempt let alone an overtake and thats even after over a 1.5km of slipstream."
Sarixk,2017-08-30,"Good race from Max but looking at GR, Lewis and Kimi you can't overtake right now. I'm pretty sure last year they shortened the DRS zone on the Kemmel straight and Lando was stuck behind Max for the whole race. 

At least we got rain tomorrow also very odd seeing a cooldown lap around Spa."

Gadoguz994,2024-08-07,Dirty air is worse than 2018. Tbh. If at Spa a car that's effectively 1.5s a lap faster than the nearest competition can't overtake then you gotta wonder. When do they introduce a measure for dirty air emitted and flat out limit it for teams so we can avoid this?
rv94,2012-11-11,"- Max really has these starts down to a science, genuinely don't remember the last time he had a bad start
- It's weird to see Red Bull quick on the straights and relatively slower in the corners

Daddy_Stop,2020-03-18,"Thank god we're due for a regulation change because this isn't racing. Simply qualify behind pole position at Belgium, stick on a skinny rear wing, effortlessly overtake for the lead in the first sector, and race = won. 

Meanwhile, the car in 2nd closes to half a second when race track goes bendy, but can't overtake on the bendy bits because getting too close to another car during a car race makes car go slower. 

So... we're here to watch the best drivers in the world race each other, but the *actual race-y* parts of the race (i.e the bendy bits, parts of the track that showcase a drivers technical ability) have essentially had their potential for competitive racing neutralised by the current regs... 

Red bull made a great choice with the low downforce set up today. It's faster on the straights; the only part we see overtakes on. It's slower *everywhere else* but lol who cares they can't get passed anyway!"

The DRS and the slipstream becomes almost useless when everyone is running low drag setups.

Also, RBR is not 1.5s slower than Mclaren. They have been enjoying a significant aero efficiency advantage since 2022. They used that to full effect during the sprint.

McLaren cars have more downforce but they are dogshit on the straights.

RBR have the 2nd best downforce while being ballistic down the straights."

Altruistic-Buyer-248,2025-05-23,It was good. I wouldn't say incredible. He had to defend once in 15 laps. The low downforce setup combined with not having to make a pitstop meant he just consistently needed a decent exit from turn 1 each lap.
Altruistic-Buyer-248,2025-05-23,McLaren don't fill me with confidence strategy wise. They always play it too safe. Just like Suzuka. Had all the time in the world to undercut Max. Even overcut. Instead they just reacted to him and chose to play it safe.

EpicCyclops,2013-01-11,"People are really starting to look at the last regs with rose colored glasses. The reason the top teams aren't slashing through the field is they're only tenths slower than the fastest cars, not seconds like the past. A front runner is slower than the midfield if the driver is having a bad day. In the last reg set, Hamilton, Russell and Antonelli would've cruised through the field because the rest of the cars were basically in a different league and the front would've looked exactly the same because no one could pass. These regs definitely are evolving more and more to create dirty air and make overtaking more difficult, but I still think they're a dramatic improvement over what we had in the past."
McLarenMercedes,2017-11-21,"Tbh, dirty air will always be a problem in F1 as long as you allow teams to develop their cars."

Chimp3h,2024-05-16,"The track needs work, maybe it becoming a rotation isn’t so bad"
Kingslayer1526,2020-05-05,"Mate there's nothing to manage here you literally cannot get past anyone anywhere on the grid. Remember last year? It was basically Charles sitting behind Lewis the entire race and Lando sitting behind Max the entire race until the end where it was Lewis sitting behind George when George's tires were ancient

That's all that happens since they shortened the drs zone last year."
MotoringMore,2017-02-02,"Strategy is one of their weaknesses, but they've got a new recruit (can't remember their name!) joining in the next month or so iirc"
Calvin0213,2018-07-26,Yea but if Oscar wins tomorrow in that rocket ship I’m sure many Oscar fans would call it a “brilliant” race from Oscar.
Shhray,2020-08-24,Who stopped McLaren from bringing the same setup?
singaporesainz,2023-09-23,Well good on him for putting it next to poastri with such a compromised package then
Walaii,2019-12-12,The proper race will be the exact same without rain.
nukleabomb,2018-10-24,You say this as if races are very different
RomeoSierraAlpha,2022-08-09,The cars are just garbage for racing and ruin tracks like Spa.

etunar,2016-07-29,That really puts things in perspective. Might help if it was 2 point gap between each position
Not_The_Truthiest,2016-10-08,"Its not about the length. Its about giving people a reason to want to win.


At least do half points or something."
Boddis,2014-08-20,Yeah I’m leaning that way too
Vanzmelo,2011-07-02,"I also hate how they have sprints on the best tracks. They should have sprints on lackluster tracks not Austria, Spa, and Interlagos of all tracks"
Ismokecr4k,2011-09-10,Does anyone like them? They seem so unnecessary... And ruins thr main race
rizenHeH,2020-05-07,So you enjoy free practice more than a sprint race/quali? Interesting

It's always money"
mikkelr1225,2012-07-08,"As someone on track for the entire weekend. 

Sprints are great for live spectators. 

Alot more exciting to watch 2 qualies and races, rather than just practice sessions."
Lower_Discussion4897,2020-11-09,"I was in favour of them in theory because it can be very frustrating to wait 2 weeks for a GP and then it's boring or your guy gets taken out at the first corner. I thought it would give us a second opportunity for some wheel to wheel racing. In reality though, it just doesn't seem to be a good solution."
EasyRuin5441,2024-01-05,"I’ve been to two races, one with one without. The sprint made the weekend so much enjoyable and exciting. Outside of my personal preference there is not much of a need."

lewismufc,2015-11-02,"Only other change potentially could be the point scoring. At the moment, Piastri isn’t going to risk a last second dive bomb for one extra point."
McNoKnows,2014-11-23,"Meh, I’d still have a boring sprint over 2 more practice sessions. At the worst  it still adds another qualy session, and means less prep with the setup for the race which can shake up the order come race time"
Emphursis,2011-10-22,"Never been a fan of the sprint races.  They’re basically just a preview of the first stint. The best solution is to scrap them, but if they’re here to stay then the drivers should use spec cars. No risk to their own car and the level playing field makes it a proper race in its own right. Also might lead to some more interesting results."
NessaMagick,2014-07-14,I think sprints are here to stay despite their unpopularity. Wouldn't be surprised if they put a sprint into every race weekend
nascarfan624,2017-03-04,Could you say...sprint....to their death?
bshock727,2020-07-15,Yes please. Complete waste of time for the teams and spectators alike.
Any-Milk-9986,2024-07-26,"Qatar in 23 was also good cause half the fields were on different tyres including the front runners, even Cota and Austria last year was pretty good"
stokesy1999,2017-01-22,"Even then, 4 tenths behind out of La Source and couldn't even get alongside... skinny wing in free air was too strong today, Lando showed the pace of that Mclaren in free air and closed 2 secs in about 4 laps and if you still can't overtake with a half second a lap advantage then you may as well just run a drag race down the Kimmel straight and call it a day for the sprint"
CatManWhoLikesChess,2020-12-31,He didnt because Max nailed La Source
AquaRaOne,2016-05-05,"Tbf this was just a car difference, the red bull with that setup was simply too fast in the straights"

DrVonD,2010-07-24,We literally just had an entertaining rain race in silverstone even with it absolute chucking down.
Alfus,2012-10-25,Silverstone shown otherwise
ryokevry,2018-12-16,That’s how I describe the DRS pass on Kemmel straight to my mom lol
wokwok__,2024-05-02,"They shortened the DRS zone on the straight cause it was too easy to overtake, now you can't do it at all lmao"
AegrusRS,2016-08-18,"The combination of Eau Rouge/Radillion into Kemmel is the real kicker. You essentially need a 0.3 gap or less when entering Kemmel which is almost impossible when following that close up T3-4 is incredibly difficult, like mentioned in commentary. Only chance is a massive downforce/tyre offset or a mistake by the leading car."
ThickHandshake,2021-08-12,snooze-uka
OptimalDot178,2022-01-06,"I think Piastri has a lot of extra pace in him, if he's in P1 I expect a chill Sunday cruise.

dani2001896,2022-01-29,"With these cars spa is always a red flag in constant rain...  I don't want jinx it, but I really expect a 2021 2.0. The other option is that they will try to change the hour of the race idk."
nukleabomb,2018-10-24,Thats the other extreme lol
Marcoscb,2012-11-11,He has more sprint wins than literally every person ever born combined.
Gullible_Egg_6539,2025-02-25,He has more sprint wins than there are atoms in the entire universe. Let that sink in.
SensiblySenile1618,2020-12-08,And Lewis
LosTerminators,2017-02-17,"Even cars out of position like George, Lewis and Kimi couldn't do anything."
Sektsioon,2017-10-31,"Yeah the biggest problem is they can’t follow each other close enough in S2 and then the gap will be too large in the S1 of the following lap. McLaren’s were like half a second quicker than the RB in S2 in quali, but it’s useless in dirty air. The middle pack was also in a DRS train most likely which makes it even more boring."
NaiveRevolution9072,2024-12-05,There was a pretty sizable tailwind on Kemmel which isn't helpful
CatManWhoLikesChess,2020-12-31,"2022 cars were great at following but thats not really example you want to use, Verstappen vs Leclerc was just both of them slingshotting each other over and over again because Ferrari was much quicker through t1-t2"
ATWPH77,2022-07-12,"The first lap of that race was funny too, the cars literally feelt like boats in slow motion around the slow corners when they were still in a big pack"
RandomLegend,2012-06-05,Most people on here don't even like F1 racing. They are just here for the drama. There has never been an era with easy and frequent overtaking and there never will be.
261846,2022-11-30,People really forget how bad the last set of regs were in comparison
Rivao,2017-11-26,"Yeah, people have short memories or many vocal people are new fans. This era was pretty okay. The one before it was horrid. Although 2021 was amazing, still cars could not follow for more than one lap otherwise they were cooked. The few years before 2022, you would never see a car following within a second of another car for multiple laps at the front. Whenever someone got close, if they did not pass during a lap or two at most, you knew the fight was over."
Lonyo,2011-11-20,"It's not one bad sprint. 


And he said the end of a promising era. 2022 isn't relevant when they've fucked up so hard on the rules since."
nukleabomb,2018-10-24,"Yeah we have had quite a good 2024 and 2025 after the 2023 domination. People write off shit too quickly. 

Spa also has had either drs drive byes or zero overtaking depending on the length of the drs zone, so it doesn't help."
Disco2002,2021-03-19,> qualifying
Elrond007,2015-09-10,field spread is not a good metric. You can probably pick a decade at random and have better seasons than we had with these shitty regs
nukleabomb,2018-10-24,I expect a lot of engine related dnfs lol
Own_Welder_2821,2024-06-24,"I rewatched the 2012 Spa race recently. Endless overtakes because the cars were smaller, less heavy, and the tyres degraded."
ryokevry,2018-12-16,How was last year good? Hamilton on much newer tyres could not pass Russell on ancient tyres for the win.
Altruistic-Buyer-248,2025-05-23,"Best thing they can hope for is a 1, 2 in quali, then hope at the end of the straight tomorrow they have at least 1 car at the front. Sit Max in dirty air for a few laps and hope he tyres go off so the car behind can pass."

Qyx7,2019-10-21,"If they want to improve the point distribution (I would scraps sprints altogether), they could use the distribution of races stopped after 50%, which has a 13-10-8-6-5... system with 9 point scorers"

aa0429,2018-02-19,Same and I feel whelmed about it.
lambo630,2019-01-10,Yeah and you see it throughout the field. On like lap 3 they were saying George would likely not be too aggressive because there aren’t many points up for grabs. Everyone is super conservative because qualifying is only a few hours later and that’s much more important for serious points.
Ereaser,2015-06-10,Especially not without Lando behind him already
Fenrir-The-Wolf,2016-02-15,Fucks with the flow of the weekend too much for me tbf
Liability049-6319,2025-06-04,Except most people are employed and can’t dedicate 3 days to watching meaningful sessions. I like having FP on while I’m doing other things. I have to miss sprint quali and the sprint race  90% of the time.
ryokevry,2018-12-16,"Yes. So the issue is we need deviating tyre strategy, and a better track for racing. Spa is not it."
sonofeevil,2012-02-15,"Half a second at spa isn't the same as half a second  at Austria, it's the longest track on the calendar by quite a bit.

But I get what you mean."
bored_ape07,2024-12-04,"He parked in the middle of the track, which again proves that the cars are massive and that prevents overtaking opportunities"

PsychologicalArt7451,2021-03-24,"2022 and 2023 had some good racing but it also had domination. You couldn't hold Max and even Checo back, even if they didn't have massive pace advantage. People complained about overtaking being too easy."
Red_Rabbit_1978,2021-06-10,"It's weird how skewed the memories of 2021 are. The racing was shit. We had Verstappen vs Hamilton flat out in front, a pit stop ahead of 3rd, usually Bottas. Cars couldn't follow at all within 3 seconds of each other.

The whole Silverstone crash happened because Verstappen KNEW he had to stay in front for the first lap or 2. If he didn't, it was race over. Same reason Hamilton was trying so hard to get passed him. If Verstappen had kept the lead for the first lap, race over. We saw it the day before in the Sprint, and nearly every other race before.

The ground effect era has been far better."
DrVonD,2010-07-24,"Field spread makes the constructors championship more interesting. Look at how close the mid field is, because a tenth or two difference between tracks means every team can get points and it yo-yos around. 

Field spread being close can also be more boring for each race, since the cars are all about the same pace, which makes over taking more difficult."

docherself,2019-05-07,"i'm at the track now, my first sprint - went by too fast imo."
strangebrew3522,2021-07-14,"I don't understand this mindset. Martin Brundle says it best. ""I'd rather see cars racing any day of the week over a free practice session."". 

I wasn't there today, but if you're at a race, any race, and don't enjoy the actual *racing* part of it, you're watching the wrong sport. Hell when I go to IMSA races I'm just as tuned in to the Miata spec racing as I am the main event. All racing is awesome, and I'm sure that everyone at the track was more excited to see *competition* racing of F1 cars vs a couple cars here and there collecting data during a practice session."
cosHinsHeiR,2015-08-29,Would you enjoy a practice session more than this?
mikkelr1225,2012-07-08,"Yes. 

Objectively this sprint was not exciting no. 

But compared to a practice session, then yeah its more exciting to watch in person."
Baybad,2014-06-03,"It didn't really.

Go for an overtake to advance your grid position by 1, with the chance that you destroy your car and start from the pitlane. Why would you risk it at all?

There are no championship points for pole positions normally, and that initial sprint race format which gave 1st, 2nd and 3rd minor points for staying in their qualified position was just dumb.

The only thing that would make sprints interesting is if they were more valuable than the race for the top drivers. Say 30 points for 1st down to 10 points for 8th. Everyone would drive like mad in that bottom 13 to get that 8th place, and the top would fight over the big bucks, knowing that they have a limited time, and the consquences of not attacking could be dire. 

But thats a fucking stupid idea because a 15 lap filler race would have more weight than a 60 lap main event.

The sprint races are just flawed in this sport."
John_is_Minty,2016-07-16,Th sprints were way more interesting to me when the finishing order set the grid for the Sunday race. At this point with it as it’s own standalone mini race I don’t really see the purpose of them existing
cosHinsHeiR,2015-08-29,Well just pretend it's free practice and watch just quali and race like a normal weekend?
Fordos,2014-04-27,As an Aussie it’s nice to actually have some action on a weekend that isn’t 3 am Monday morning
McNoKnows,2014-11-23,Wait till you hear about the MLB
CursingDingo,2015-03-23,This is such a terrible take. Because you are “too busy” the sport should have less meaningful sessions?
strangebrew3522,2021-07-14,"> Except most people are employed and can’t dedicate 3 days to watching meaningful sessions. 

I mean no offense but, tough cookies for you. I have F1TV and can catchup whenever I miss it live, and on weekends I'm off and free to watch the Sprints. I'd much rather see cars racing than just mindless practice sessions. 

So yeah, the sprint was boring. That's not the sprint races fault, that's the fault of the regs. We're deep into this regulation period where all the cars are very similar in performance and once you get a DRS train going, there's little chance of breaking it. Maybe lets get new rules for Sprints only. Mandatory tire usage/pitstops. Something, anything just to shake it up a little bit. 

MotoGP has sprint races on Saturday and they can be super exciting."
Palmul,2014-05-11,Idk why they insist on holding a sprint race in Spa. Clearly it brings nothing
Any-Milk-9986,2024-07-26,I believe that’s also due to the fact that from last year they also shortened the drs straight so that it’s not a slam dunk move if you have drs
ComprehensiveRide246,2020-10-25,We just got out from watching it and I'm so glad I get this reference lol
Quick-Permission-698,2025-04-14,"Oh dont get me wrong, I think sprints are stupid, but if we must have them as liberty wants them, surely better overtaking tracks are better for the minute chance of an overtake"

Drewsche,2016-07-04,"Thank you for this. I'm a casual watcher, and I was very confused to see qualifying after a sprint. I thought the point of the sprint was to have a ""different style"" of setting the race grid. These extra sprints seem pretty pointless now, though."
Liability049-6319,2025-06-04,"Fair enough, but would you call that “action”? Sprint races are just 15-20 laps of tire management after lap 1"

Vanzmelo,2011-07-02,"My understanding of sprint weekends was to make race weekends more exciting. With that in  mind, why not use them on tracks that are notorious for being unexciting? Instead of making the highs higher make the lows closer to the highs if that makes sense"

WHITEY1887,2018-08-28,"He’s admitted he’s made errors in both qualifying sessions and apologised for it. I’m not sure why there’s this myth floating around that he doesn’t accept responsibility.

The best of his generation, one of the best drivers of all time. Super respectful. The driver who was set to win a record 8th title but saw it robbed from him, and still took it like a man, showing grace to Max etc. 

He’s been getting that Ferrari into similar positions as his teammate for most of a very disappointing season. The way he’s talked about by some you’d think he was 12th in the Championship and miles off it.

It’s the twilight of his stunning career, he’s getting older, and yes, even as a big fan I can see and accept that. Not that he does.

Mega disappointing weekend. But I’ve watched every race he’s competed in and there have been plenty like it. That’s sport."

But for that matter, Hamilton has mastered always saying contrary things so if it turns out well, it's forgotten. If it goes poorly, well look Hamilton complained. *Every* strategy choice on basically anything sees Hamilton publicly voice his disagreement (so his fans can all do the laughable ""I can't believe Ferrari/Mercedes could do this to the gOAT!"").

If you didn't hear something wrong with the downshifts during the sprint quali, especially considering we've never seen Hamilton literally spin going straight, it was understandable to think there was an issue.

Then Lewis and Ferrari said there wasn't.

Prior to that there was no reason to think something hadn't gone wrong since the gear shifts sounded terrible and a driver who isn't known for spinning literally spun going straight."
Rivendel93,2022-07-02,Do you say the same to Alonso? Who gets beat by Lance fking stroll?
Rivendel93,2022-07-02,So what's Alonso? Why doesn't he get all this attention from you?
Rivendel93,2022-07-02,"Guess that's why he came in P4 last week when Leclerc was last.

Or when he finished P4 in the constructors in 2023 and George finished P8.

Or maybe when he won Silverstone in the third best car last year."
NegotiationNew9264,2023-01-09,No way you’re blame the car for track limits in T4

I really don't see it. He's like the 8th best driver on the grid these days, and his best day isn't top 3 anymore"

Rivendel93,2022-07-02,"Fans like you are way more annoying.

The car absolutely sounded like it had a mechanical failure during the sprint quali, it was also one of the most unusual spins I've ever seen.

When does Lewis just spin going straight?

Hell, Anthony Davis said he thought it was a mechanical issue.

Obviously the team said it wasn't, Lewis said it wasn't, and he took the blame today, so what the hell do you want from him?

Don't judge a driver by his fans, judge the driver by the driver. He admits fault when it's his fault, as he did yesterday and today."

Every year of his career, he has 2 or 3 disasterclasses, its consistent throughout his career, not one year has he maximised himself throughout, 2015 comes the closest imo.

A lot of these came when the Merc was so far ahead that the result wasn't awful and could get a p4 out of it, but was still a very bad weekend pace wise."
kennyismyname,2014-01-07,I reckon you can add Abu Dhabi 2021 as a potential worst weekend of his career for him

Magictank2000,2019-03-04,are you surprised?
Justanothercrow421,2013-07-02,Yesterday’s spin has been largely blamed on a mechanical issue. Today is on him though.
Bradtothebone,2012-03-28,The back axle locking up in sq1 and sending him into a pirouette was his fault? More likely that Ferrari brought upgrades to a sprint weekend and didn’t have time get the car balance right and made an unstable car.

Vuk13,2017-06-12,True but there is clearly something going on this qualifying session with both cars. 19th and 20th is really weird considering Alonso got to Q3 every race since Imola except Silverstone where he was 11th
Vuk13,2017-06-12,No one is mentioning Leclerc here though. Leclerc was like 1s ahead. Ferrari is 3rd best car this weekend and as you said should be in Q3. AM looked like the worst car today
Vuk13,2017-06-12,What is he supposed to do? The car seems to be the slowest they either messed up the setup or upgrades aren't working as they should. Or went for the wet setup

UnderTakaMichinoku,2024-07-24,"Yuki finally having a near current spec car and his performance improves. I think people have forgotten that he's very rarely had a car anywhere near the spec that Max has had.

To my knowledge he had the same spec in Japan, Bahrain and Saudi (the latter duo he made Q3), he had it in Imola before they took the new nose off (Max's broke so they put it on his car) before qualifying and then he had a big crash that meant he then had essentially the pre-Imola car until Canada. Then he's had nothing new since Canada until today. Meanwhile the rest of the midfield have continued to bring upgrades making his job in that car even harder.

This is the tightest field we've ever seen where 2 tenths can make up 6/7 spots. I wondered yesterday if the new floor would have snuck him into Q3 yesterday and today we have that answer.

It's by no means perfect, but being thrown into qualifying today with 0 laps with the new floor, this is a good result. Hopefully he can convert it into solid points tomorrow."

in sprint quali he was 5th in q2 but 10th in q3, again with a slower lap time than his q2 attempt

and now he's a second slower than lawson in p9 and 1.8s slower than norris in pole, with a lap time comparable to that of alonso in q1

- Max was still miles faster before the final q3 run, where he made a big mistake in t1 which costed him around 3 tenths probably. By that reckoning, the actual gap between them is still around 7 tenths, but considering its the longest track, that is still an improvement over the past races."

I think those teams that can barely get to Q3 tend to slow down and play it safe since there's not a strong incentive since the best they can get from there is like P8, but a shunt is super expensive in time and money. Better to save resources for the race. I remember Albon and before him Russel in the Williams doing similar things, insane laps to get to Q3 then straight into P10 with barely a competitive lap."

Vuk13,2017-06-12,We really don't know and don't know to how much of an extent they did. There clearly did something drastic as Alonso's worst starting position since Imola was 11th in Silverstone.

bouncybreadstick,2023-07-06,"ngl this weekend has been terrible so far, but it gets so tiring that every time he has a bad session almost all the comments start talking about retirement and that the ferrari move was the worst thing to happen to him. he could’ve retired after 2021, any year after that actually, he could’ve finished his career in the comfort of a team he knew at mercedes and let toto make the decision to retire for him after 2025 by putting kimi in his seat, but he didn’t because MAYBE he enjoys racing and competing even now that he’s not at the front? he was p4 just last race so it’s not been a disaster after another. he’s disappointed in himself but he has more resilience than people give him credit for and he gives a lot to the sport even if he’s not at the top anymore."

Anon-eh-moose,2016-02-01,"Can’t say I didn’t have higher hopes for this Ferrari stint, but people are so hyperbolic. Multiple things can be true.

Ferrari don’t have a car that can challenge for the title. It’s still probably 3rd best. Hamilton has been on a decline ever since 21. Some of that will be age, some of it may be lack of adaptability to the new era of cars. He finishes P6/7 because that’s pretty much where he is on merit. He’s not faster than Lando, Oscar, Max, Charles, or George in the top teams right now. 

He also needs to tone down his rhetoric which I understand is probably a hard mental shift. I don’t think he’s going to challenge for another title at this stage of his career. Focusing on a win or podiums should be the first goal. 

He’s not totally washed either. His quali lap got done because of a tight track limits call that didn’t really gain him much time. Before the DQ he was pretty much at Charles’ time. He’s also only 11 points behind Leclerc. 

He’s not a contender anymore. The question is if he’s willing to accept that and drive for the sake of it, like Alonso, or if he should accept it and retire."

cuntsmen,2015-06-27,"> Father time is undefeated

Yep. I don't see him truly challenging for another championship in this last part of his career. However, even if his performances have dropped, he can still be valuable to the team. He's been a part of winning teams all of his career. He knows what a winning team should look like and he might be able to force that culture to the team. Ferrari would be stupid not to listen to him when it comes to the structure of the team."

Edit: I should add that they butted heads with Nigel Mansell in 1990 which led to him going back to Williams, and that they sacked Prost in 1991 because he rightfully criticised the car.

It's fine to admit when your favourite driver/team fucks up. It happens. No one is infallible. I love Ferrari to death, but when they fuck up (which is often) I call them out on it. When they have screwed Lewis over this season through bad strategy and shit communication, I've raged against them, not defended them.

Safin_22,2021-09-16,"The problem is that everyone treated him as the next Verstappen for years in the feeder series while he is not. Dont get me wrong, he will be a very good driver, maybe even WDC, but he is no Max.

He always had big advantages over the field since karting, unlimited testing and best car, but they put him too quickly in F1, 2 years ago he was a rookie in Freca.

It has happened in the past, with Vandoorne and Magnussen( father) that they were the next coming but never got there. They are putting to much pressure on him.

Russell is a world class driver. But as other comment said, being 2-29 on competitive sessions is very concerning even if you are a rookie against a top driver, giving that you are expected to be a WDC in the future.

I don’t remember a past WDC that had such a record in any point of their career in F1, but than again very few had a rookie season against such a good driver."
No_Feedback6167,2020-12-06,"I love the guy but anyone else think he should’ve spent time in alpine/williams for a year or two? Putting an 18 year old kid in a top 4 team is way too much pressure. Even Max Verstappen had to fuck around in toro Rosso for a season before he got the call to Red Bull.

Rosieu,2013-09-09,"Oh no...Last year when Kimi was announced for Merc I was afraid they might move him to fast. Like yes, sometimes you have immense huge talents who can already handle pressure at a younger age (like Max around that age), but most really need some time.


However Kimi has shown some really great stuff already this season. So I hope he gets some good counseling who can convince him to believe more in himself. Mistakes are okay in your rookie season and as well when you're that young. Pace wise there's room to grow too and he should be given that time to grow as we've seen as well that it is really there at times already."

Ponichkata,2020-10-24,"He has potential but I think it was a big mistake putting him a top team in his first year.

The Netflix documentary, taking Hamilton's seat, having George as a team mate AND the rumours of Max moving to Merc while not having a contract is a lot of pressure and expectations at the same time.

They should have let him get experience in Williams or Alpine where there isn't the same pressure or scrutiny. Even Red Bull lets its juniors have some time in a junior team so they can mature as drivers."
maccartney,2018-01-12,"Toto's obsession with Verstappen has the potential to destroy the career of not one, but two of his own juniors. 


George is a top 3 driver on the grid, who was first left in a backmarker for 3 years, and then hasn't been given a car in the last 4 years that could be competitive for more than three consecutive rounds. 


While Kimi was rushed through the junior formulas into F1, and is unable to show enough pace or mental strength that'd be required in a top team.


Toto can continue winking outside. But that won't fix his car, and won't bring back the engineers and personell they have lost over the years. On top of that, his two own drivers will just lose faith and confidence in the team."

I can’t imagine the max rumors are helping at all, so I just hope he’s got good support around him so it doesn’t break his stride."
ellen_boot,2017-11-08,"I feel so bad for him.  If he did well this year,  it would have been because he had a great car.  If he did poorly, it's he couldn't handle the pressure. I know he's had a rough time lately,  but several of his problems have been outside his control.  Over all,  I still think he's one of the better young drivers we've seen over the past few years.  

 He's already done great,  and I know he can do even more,  but I doubt half the people here would be able to withstand the pressure he been under without a bit of a breakdown. And even fewer would have been able to do it at his age.

This is on partially Toto who should have shut this down, or Ola needs to be kept in line by the other CEOs.

You'll upset not only 2 of their own drivers, but I imagine others will avoid going to Merc if it's this weird an obsession.

You never want to see an 18 yr old crying on TV who's clearly feeling the pressure. It's not his fault, none of this is his fault.

He will obviously have bad moments as this is his rookie season and not everyone can be Max Verstappen as a teenager. I hope everything works out for him.
MechaniVal,2017-08-23,"People saying Antonelli isn't performing, is nowhere near a Verstappen level talent, because he isn't matching Russell already, seem to be forgetting that even Verstappen and Piastri didn't immediately start dominating top level teammates. 

Yes, in the midfield Toro Rosso Verstappen beat Sainz. But he didn't beat Ricciardo in the Red Bull until 2018.

And Piastri got less than half of Norris' points in 2023.

Do we think Russell is a worse driver than Ricciardo and Norris? I don't. So why would Antonelli be matching Russell halfway through his rookie season? Yeah his points total is looking pretty bad - but he's had 3 DNFs outside his control, plus incidents and bad strat calls that weren't his fault either. Only a handful of his poor results are actually his own doing.

Account for those and honestly I think he's having a Piastri against Norris tier first season, and I hope people don't think McLaren should've dropped Piastri after his rookie year!"
A-MBoi,2019-10-16,I'm not sure they should put rookies in top teams
XOVSquare,2020-04-09,"Hope he talks to other drivers, maybe to Lando specifically. Would love to see this guy reach the heights everyone knows he's capable of."
wowbaggerBR,2018-04-06,"Took a while longer, but he is melting emotionally as people said he would."
Jimmymead_,2019-07-31,"Mercedes management are fucking this kid around too much and it’s very clear to see. No way he can juggle learning to be an f1 driver as well as trying to secure a longer contract at such a young age. He either is your future or not, stop stringing him along"
catseye_mousehole,2024-01-16,"It’s undeniable that Kimi’s talent is real—I don’t want recency bias to make me forget how great that Canada podium was—but man. Hard to argue that he doesn’t deserve a Mercedes seat generally, but the question is probably less “does he deserve a Mercedes seat?” and more “does him being in the Mercedes seat right now make weekends like Canada more likely to be repeated, or less?” And it’s also getting hard to argue that the answer is “more”.

The talk about Max maybe taking his seat can’t have been good for his psychologicals. But at the same time, it’s lose-lose on the pressure front if you’re Kimi, isn’t it? I can’t see a situation where putting him next to Max doesn’t increase the pressure a hundredfold, even if Max is the nicest teammate in the world."
AChunkyMother,2012-02-06,Just go chase some points young blood. F1 fans are rooting for ya!
WaluigisHat,2014-06-27,"Hopefully he has good people around him to stabilise him a bit. When the reality of expectation in elite level sport hits, it hits hard. He's shown multiple times the speed and skill is there, but there's been a lot of sloppiness too."
Almostgone321,2020-05-16,"Max Verstappen “if he dies, he dies”"
UnderTakaMichinoku,2024-07-24,"This is just sad to see. He's a rookie. One with as much pressure entering the sport as anyone since Lewis. I don't even recall Max having as much pressure as Kimi did on his arrival. 

He's supremely talented, but he's still a kid at a huge team. I've seen enough so far when he's peaking to know the talent is there. We're halfway through the season and he's already got a sprint pole and a podium. 

The consistency will come as he ages. 2026 should be better for him for numerous reasons, one being the reset of the regulations and everyone having to learn new parts of the car which isn't the case this year except for the rookies."
Mrs_Doyles_Teabags,2024-01-05,"He's still a kid and under severe pressure, now Merc needs to look after him and build his confidence"
gomurifle,2010-09-26,Max Verstappen X Russell 2026 confirmed!!
Mysterious_Turnip310,2021-09-04,"He's had a bad run the last three weekends but the car has also been poor by Merc's standards. The race prior to that he got his first podium. Amazing how many people who watch F1 and how much of the F1 media have the attention span of gnats.

Russell not only has a lot more experience on track but also a lot more experience with the tempremental cars Mercedes have produced this set of regs (and with dealing with the hit and miss strategies from the pitwall) and even he's been struggling at times. It's no wonder Antonelli's finding it tougher to deal with. Add to that the constant media speculation around Verstappen and Merc, and Toto's inability recently to properly back either of his drivers publicly, it's no surprise it's getting to Antonelli. He's 18 years old ffs and he's not a robot."
Parking-Car-8433,2021-04-11,"Well he underdelivers (he is good but not the next Hamilton / Verstappen) and everyone realizes it, including himself"
Financial-Praline921,2020-10-31,I knew he wouldnt live upto the hype
MountainEquipment401,2021-01-11,So he's going to be in an Alpine soon right? Colapintos not performing and Bottas is sexy asf.
Arkhet,2020-03-16,"Ah yes, the fake Kimi."
SmileCompetitive1686,2024-07-21,Sissy
Nice_Database_9684,2025-03-17,Man knows he’s in hot water
FormulaGymBro,2024-09-10,"Who's the best candidate to replace him, if Verstappen doesn't move?

\- Ocon

\- Vettel

\- Schumacher

\- Leclerc

\- Bottas

\- Sainz

I think any of them would be doing a much better job imo"
_____AAAAAAAAAA_____,2020-05-11,He's also got the pressure to turn it around after SQ1 exit. Plus it's Spa of all places.
SubcooledBoiling,2017-01-06,This is why it’s important to have young drivers at midfield teams during the first few years. They get a chance to learn to deal with pressure and expectations.
Deep-Acanthaceae-659,2021-10-23,I can’t imagine that helping at all
Blurandski,2015-12-16,"It's a really tough place for everyone - if Wolff is expecting Merc to be competitive with McLaren next year Kimi is current the difference between the WCC and not - 4 tenths average is a massive gap, as is 29-2 in competitive sessions, and if anything the difference in relative performances is getting wider. If is confidence is going then pace is the next thing to go - just see Colapinto after a couple of crashes last year.

Dropping him entirely would be brutal but realistically Alpine is the only team that may be interested in him, have a Merc engine & have space next year?"
DarkImpacT213,2016-03-09,"I mean, that's most definetly part of it - although I can't help but think that such a young and new driver would be online alot and gets a lot more attached to hateful comments towards them which has definetly increasingly been happening - even on Merc's subreddit, instagram and youtube channel"
only_r3ad_the_titl3,2024-04-25,For all the shit Horner gets it is weird that Toto escapes the criticism for his driver treatement which is arguably worse
GiantT-Rex,2025-07-01,"He’s 18. He shouldn’t be in F1. He’s not currently good enough, nor mature enough, to handle the pressure. He was promoted way too early."
Particular_Cod2005,2025-05-14,"Problem is, Toto should've put him at Williams for a couple of years to warm up. He needs to realise that Max was lightning in a bottle, and rookies are rarely magical when they first turn the wheel.

I think there's talent there for Kimi; his pole at Miami shows there's something there, but I think he just needs to grow for a season before he went to Mercedes."
ClimateOk3630,2022-08-28,"The problem is that I really don't think the Max replacement rumors are only involving George. If you pay attention to what Toto's been saying it gives the vibes that he just cares about getting his hands on Max, and contrary to the media narrative he doesn't really care who he has to boot to do it. Although after this weekend so far I'm not sure how appealing they look for Max now /j"
CrinkleCutSpud2,2024-07-29,"I'm sure what's also on his mind is that since Imola, he had that mega weekend in Montreal but Barcelona (not his fault), Austria and Silverstone all ended in retirement."
Ill-Barracuda7403,2024-09-19,"I think the narrative that it was all about George suited them, because George is a tough cookie and can deal with it. 

George is one of my favourite drivers, but as soon as it started the encompass Kimi I felt really angry, because he shouldn't have to deal with it. George is fine. He's an adult and used to the pressure. Kimi is not."
NathDritt,2019-02-05,I think in this case it actually mostly has to do with the car. It doesn’t seem to be suiting Spa at the moment. Russell was slower and couldn’t understand why. Kimi said he couldn’t find confidence. I just don’t think this is Merc’s race like it was last year.
Jphorne89,2019-09-07,I think fans (in most sports too) always underestimate the mental hurdle playing in the biggest stage can take on rookies
GrapefruitAlways26,2023-01-06,Dude graduated high school after he started his rookie season. Toto touting him as the next Max Verstappen. Can't imagine the pressure he faces every race weekend.
MindDependent1500,2023-02-13,"Where was this support for the likes of Doohan, Stroll, Mick, Zhou, Sargeant etc? They instead got more hate and criticism and fans telling them them don’t deserve to be in F1. All while driving a significantly worse car."
GiantT-Rex,2025-07-01,That’s why he shouldn’t be in F1 right now. He was promoted too early. The pressure has got to him and now he’s flailing.
Fabian_Riven,2016-05-06,"Maybe he should have a few talks with Max about his mentality. ""Just focus on the things you influence"", is easier said than done but it is the way it works to stay mentally healthy as a driver.

The pressure and work rate are immense for such a young guy but he has a great head on his shoulders."
Distinct_Ad_6023,2022-01-20,I think he's to busy with Lewis rn 😭
Davan94,2020-07-08,Saint Anthony of Consolation
CaptGeechNTheSSS,2012-10-20,Everyone thinks he was consoling hadjar but he was actually trash talking him.
Suikerspin_Ei,2020-02-14,Basically like Bottas during his first stint with Mercedes. Every year a one year contract puts a lot of pressure and uncertainty to his future. Affects their mind and in the end performance.
TopStar200,2024-04-03,If the car is shit next year... Russell is definitely walking too. They have screwed themselves massively.
Uchi_Jeon,2021-10-31,"I really feel sorry for these Merc drivers, thank God Zak won't do this to Papaya drivers. Why put unnecessary pressure on your young talented drivers while your cars so shit?"
Independent_Newt_298,2020-10-07,let's form a queue
arbysroastbeefs2,2025-01-22,We all do
VenusDeMiloArms,2021-06-27,"Max also had the best kart, essentially unlimited access to resources his competitors didn't, etc. Vandoorne didn't get a fair shake when he came up. Everything else you said is valid but there's every reason to believe Kimi is the next great driver."
tankmode,2011-11-05,"he won a regional F4 and did pretty meh in F2  while Lando, George, Piastri were all F2/F3 champions

he was hyped and promoted too fast"
Pattox,2019-05-31,"Adding to this: Kimi has an amazing opportunity. Toto expects Verstappen-grade. First races went well, now some s\*\*t hits the fan. It's managing expectations, and maybe they have been too high for Kimi. He's a good driver. He's not Verstappen."
newthhang,2017-05-19,"From my understanding Williams is not ""babysitting"" (for a lack of a better term) rookies anymore.  Alpine could have been an option & there were rumors surrounding a swap to Alpine for 2026 if Max went in the team. However, looking at Kimi's docu-series -- Kimi takes those crashes/mistakes very hard, he had such a hard time after the crash in FP1 back in 2024.  Every time he apologizes a hundred times for his mistakes and that has been happening since the beginning of the season - nothing new.  But I feel like the media and fans are overreacting a bit -- he has had 3 DNFs out of his hands. Not too long ago he got sprint pole, he got podium in Canada. He could also climb in the points tomorrow - especially since there might be rain."
renjunation,2019-07-24,"Sure, but Mercedes doesn't have a junior team. Williams has its own driver academy and is looking for long-term drivers, and Alpine is... uhm, Alpine, plus they'll only become customers next year. Realistically there was no team to loan him to"
dl064,2011-11-18,"The race episode last week on this year's rookies largely concluded this.

Merc keep saying the media are putting too much pressure on him, but then are the ones to big him up. The media didn't put a 6th form student into their F1 car."
SapphireSquid89,2022-06-25,"Yes, absolutely. It wouldn’t have been any slight on his talent/potential to have done this."
FormulaGymBro,2024-09-10,"It should have been Schumacher in that Mercedes. Antonelli is what happens when you stick a P6/P7 F2 driver in the second fastest car. 

Piastri is doing well, but he also aced F3 and F2."
Rhythm_Morgan,2018-08-15,Same. I can hold it together but as soon as that question is asked I BAWL. There’s something about it
impelagato,2025-02-11,"I'm 100% sure Toto gave him all the support he needed. Most likely, those tears are simply the result of his own bitter personal disappointment, the kid is extremely ambitious and as many champions are, he's his own harshest critic. But I have no doubt that the Mercedes environment has been very healthy and supportive to him.

When Toto signed a rookie I'm sure he knew that weekends like this would happen from time to time

EDIT: grammar"
Any_Inflation_2543,2021-10-08,There have been some rumours that it is Daimler boss Ola Källenius who is the most aggressive Verstappen shagger so this is likely his fault.
Despacitosuarez,2020-11-09,"The issue is Williams and Alpine would both say no. Williams no longer want to be a junior team, and Alpine is just doing their own thing."
DarkImpacT213,2016-03-09,"Imo an extra year in F2 wouldnt have hurt him, I'm sure he could've clutched the Championship which would've definetly been a massive confidence boost.

The only reason why he is already in F1 for Merc in particular right now is because Hamilton didn't want to go on a one year contract (which is fair enough, not blaming him obv, that situation was a mess) and Max didn't wanna leave RBR, with those two things having been Toto's Plan A and B for this season."
Any_Inflation_2543,2021-10-08,"There is a rumour that it is Ola Källenius (Daimler CEO) who is so obsessed with Max while Toto wants to keep Kimi and George. 

That puts the question into the hands of Sir Jim Ratcliffe or Toto's negotiating skills (or Max, who according to AMuS and Martin Brundle wants to stay at RBR for at least 2026)."
ryokevry,2018-12-16,"I am not worried about George because he is experienced and strong enough to navigate through it even Mercedes did anything wrong. 

But Kimi is just a kid with a few months experience in F1"
Desperate_Owl_7586,2022-09-12,"I completely agree. I really like Russell, but I don't like Mercedes and Toto anymore. It's not fair at all what they're doing with the contract. This is clearly affecting the two boys mentally and it's clear they're not doing well. And the car is terrible this weekend too."
AntheaBrainhooke,2019-12-28,"And for the first half of the year he was still at school.

That workload would have broken most people his age. The fact he's still here speaks volumes."
newthhang,2017-05-19,"He basically explained that he doesn't have confidence with the car and that stops him from pushing, he gave the example of pushing too hard in the sprint quali and ending up spinning and how that hurt his confidence even more."
giamfreeg,2015-08-27,"Right? Same with Colapinto. Briatore on his neck saying he's fine if he is fast, doesn't crash and scores points. But when he falls for that pressure it's because he's just not good enough"
kbtech,2014-05-02,Haha exactly there are so many other rookies who are doing better than Kimi
pixieok,2016-12-10,"They're hating on Franco too who's also struggling a lot  with the worst car, it's so frustrating.

I just hope he has a good family behind him that can help him go through this shitty situation, I'm sure he'll be on the grid for many years, that's not a problem for him."
newthhang,2017-05-19,"I think it's called having empathy for someone having a hard time? 

Also, people defended Doohan & even Sargent when they lost their seats. Stroll is just an easy target. Zhou was pretty much ignored."
ryokevry,2018-12-16,"Because he got a podium and on sprint pole. His speed is clear even he is driving a faster car. As a rookie, ultimate speed is everything. Other names you listed are not having the same talent. And people are very sympathetic about Doohan"
MesmersCure,2023-04-04,Kimi is significantly younger that the drivers you mentioned. I think that makes a pretty big difference.
BBYY9090,2023-04-18,Toto was so bad for this
Blurandski,2015-12-16,"It works both ways - it's no good for him going out week after week seeing himself drop four tenths to his teammate, then push harder, end up in the wall/gravel, lose further confidence in pushing the car and repeat. It's exactly the same as Gasly & Albon (both very very solid midfield drivers who got stuck in that doom loop early in their careers) in Red Bull at the moment.

At least Alpine would be a reset, and a teammate who AKA should be able to beat if he is the talent he's supposed to be."
GiantT-Rex,2025-07-01,"Why? He should’ve been given time in F2. Maybe put him back there next season, then see how he’s doing. Promoting him at 18 made no sense."
wykeer,2024-02-12,because for/the FIA is a bit anal about media duties and you will catch a penalty if you dont have a very good reason to miss them.
AntheaBrainhooke,2019-12-28,Fuck Marko. He's a dinosaur.
RemoteMeasurement10_,2024-12-14,It worked
Ichigosf,2019-10-11,"Verstappen had more pressure. They were looking for any excuse to ban him. They even put a minimum age requirement before Max raced his first GP.


He's not supremely talented. You just bought the lie Toto sold you. Lance Stroll has peaks too, doesn't mean he is supremely talented. Stroll got a podium on a Williams in his rookie season."
Ichigosf,2019-10-11,Colapinto is better than Antonelli.
Alvaro_Rey_MN,2020-06-10,Found Helmut Marko's alt account!
humildemarichongo,2020-03-01,"Kimi was thought to be Mercedes's equivalent of Verstappen. He is obviously very good but has had a knock to his confidence. It would make no sense to do anything other than stick with him, Piastri was 3 years older than Kimi is now before he even got in an F1 car. Was he promoted too soon? Possibly. But they may as well stay the course now, the potential upside is too big, which is to potentially have 15-20 years sorted for one of their seats."
Kernowder,2017-07-05,"Imagine having to deal with this level of pressure at 18 years of age. I know he's immensely privileged to be where he is, but it's hard not to feel for the kid."
jvstinf,2017-06-19,Not really.
Loightsout,2020-12-09,"What. Why would you replace an 18 year old talent with any of those guys. Sure most of them would perform better than a rookie. Big surprise.

And dude stop with Schumacher. He is done. He might get a seat at a lower team but not the Merc seat. Lmao."
ComeonmanPLS1,2018-01-14,I don't get what Spa has to do with it
Affectionate_Sky9709,2023-02-10,"Midfield and backmarker teams do not necessarily have lower expectations. Look at Alpine. It depends on the individual work environment, not the strength of the car. Like I think McLaren was a great team for Lando when they were I guess upper midfield, and a great team for Oscar when they were the performance rollercoaster that was 2023 McLaren."
Eggplantosaur,2016-07-26,"A mild downside (for top teams at least) is that those teams have their own juniors now. Mercedes can't park their juniors at Williams anymore, and they don't have control over midfield teams like Red Bull+RB and Ferrari+Haas. 


They might get some of that back with Alpine scaling back their influence in the sport, but who knows really. Mercedes just had no choice but to put Antonelli in the car, or else they risk losing him."

Visionary_Socialist,2021-01-07,"It’s weird that everyone has been pointing to George as the only one who could give way for Max when I feel like there’s a chance it could be Kimi. Not that I think it happens, but as you said it’s not helpful. 

Toto hyped him up so immensely and so did everyone else, to the point we forgot he’s basically the youngest driver in a competitive car we’ve seen since Leclerc, and he had a season more, Verstappen and Hamilton. And he’s arguably got a worse car than all of the above had when they got their first run in a good car."
Any_Inflation_2543,2021-10-08,La Gazzetta stated that Toto was in talks about the Alpine seat for Kimi with Briatore.
buffa_noles,2019-10-02,"Ferrari would scoop him instantly. he's an Italian F1 driver who shows promise.

Ill-Barracuda7403,2024-09-19,"Unfortunately he may not be able to. Mercedes manage his career and it sounds like he is not allowed to seek out other teams. I wonder what is in those Mercedes junior contracts as George has said a couple of times in the last few weeks that he has no control. It's the first time he has said it so openly. He may not be able to walk, even if he wanted to. And if he could, would they let him go to a team where he could be danger to them? Sit on that...

So, yes, they fund your career, but you give your autonomy away it seems."
Safin_22,2021-09-16,"The problem is: it never happened before ( that I remember) that à WDC had such a poor record against a teammate in any point of their career. I know, he is young, George is amazing and context is very important.

Kobebeef9,2017-03-25,"Of course and I may be speculating but him showing up like this to the pen isn’t acceptable and I think back to when Hadjar crashed in Australia and Lewis dad put his arm around him to provide comfort.

Since then Hadjar has been flying, maybe these guys needs to let it all out emotionally to exceed."
Alfus,2012-10-25,"If Merc would drop Kimi it is very likely shoved into Toto mouth to do so, I mean if he could get Verstappen it would be more likely with Kimi together and basically filling in a dream Toto never could get until recently.

If I was Russell I would obvious fishing and building up contact with some rival teams, if not for 26 then for 27."
Ponichkata,2020-10-24,That's very true
VenusDeMiloArms,2021-06-27,What's the source for the rumors?
StaffFamous6379,2020-09-22,The F1 paddock is called the Piranha Club for a reason.
DontGetBanned6446,2025-03-24,"Ah yes, one of the most successful F1 teams needs to be catering to the mental well-being of it's ""two boys"" instead of doing what they can to bring the best talent to their team and win championships."
MindDependent1500,2023-02-13,"Disagree, people actively cheered against Doohan and Sergeant sending them death threats and find their family members emails to harass them. Doesn’t  seem your so called empathy extends past anyone not named Kimi just like many others."
Ichigosf,2019-10-11,Lance Stroll also had a podium in his rookie season and it was on a Williams...
Halkatlaa,2017-10-23,Lance was getting death threats back in 2017. When he was 18.
kristal010,2014-03-14,Hate that
jroache,2013-01-06,Lets go
DontGetBanned6446,2025-03-24,Piastri would have gotten into F1 sooner if it wasn't for Alpine's shenanigans and there was a team willing to give him a spot. McLaren did and it's paying off for them -- he's ice cold and handles pressure extremely well.
GiantT-Rex,2025-07-01,Is he very good though? He hasn’t been good for 7 races in a row now.
Nice_Database_9684,2025-03-17,"He has been very meh for quite a number of races now

If he doesn’t impress, George could keep his seat and Kimi could be out for Verstappen"
FormulaGymBro,2024-09-10,"He's in the second fastest car. He's just lost P2 in the WCC and P4 is coming ever closer. 

Toto will be telling him to get his head together. 

Mick Schumacher would be making it to Q3 every race weekend"
FormulaGymBro,2024-09-10,"???

Every driver on my list except Schumacher is a race winner and have more years of F1 experience than Russell.

Schumacher has my full backing for a good F1 drive. Whether that's at Alpine , Cadillac or Mercedes.

Yes they would all perform better. Put them in the car then lol"
SirFrags,2010-03-09,The legacy of the race and the technicality of the modern layout make it probably the most well regarded track in calendar by drivers.
_____AAAAAAAAAA_____,2020-05-11,"Spa qualifying is psychologically challenging on top of his already high pressure. The number of corners mean possibility of mistakes is high. There are essential corners that if you don't exit perfectly will ruin whole sectors. Long lap time and track length mean your strategy is limited: can't do back-to-back flying laps because of too much fuel for the first run and not enough battery or tire life for the second, so fewer chances to get it right. You're also supposed to save tires for Q3 if you're driving a Mercedes so that further reduces the trials allowed in Q1. Finally, Spa has few and far between opportunities to overtake so qualifying out of place puts you behind slow cars in DRS trains, and that adds stake to the qualifying."
MarkEsmiths,2024-02-15,They are trying to say that this could have happened at a better track. Like COTA.
bostromnz,2014-07-01,They had him locked up. He wasn’t going anywhere
KingMaple,2016-08-02,Very true. Toto wanted Kimi in hopes he becomes Max caliber. Kimi is not needed if he gets Max. The only trouble of George is that Max has had issues with George.
sfcindolrip,2021-08-06,"I think people assumed merc were so traumatized by rosberg/hamilton acrimony, jockeying for status, and factionalism that they wouldn’t readily walk into Russell/Verstappen redux"
limhy0809,2020-04-06,"The thing with Max is that if you got him and a good car. You don't really need a great 2nd driver. So George being the more expensive, older driver. Seems like the sensible choice to remove. Max gets the 3rd best car in 2024 wins by 63 points. You got a rising star who can start who can wait and cost less.

If the 2026 mercedes is half as good as they say it is. Max can win the WDC before Abu Dhabi."
Blurandski,2015-12-16,"Hopefully that comes off - makes sense for everyone involved. He is clearly not ready for a top team yet. Even if he did get dropped he probably still has the escape valve of back to F2 and (hopefully) dominate that while maturing a bit more.

Good barometer for him as well - Gasly is a good midfield driver, if he beats Antonelli over a full season then it probably confirms Antonelli isn't the one that was promised, if Antonelli does then he's ready for the promotion.

That second Merc seat would be interesting - Bottas is the safe call but it might be worth trying to lure Sainz."
FormulaGymBro,2024-09-10,I would love for Schumacher to get the Alpine seat
Blurandski,2015-12-16,"Yeah that rotation does make sense. However I can't see Merc letting go of him fully even if he does get dropped. 

Antonelli-Bearman at Haas would be incredibly interesting. Two extremely talented and hyped young drivers, but realistically only one of them would escape that season with top team credentials outside of it being even & Haas massively over performing."
StaffFamous6379,2020-09-22,Marko was as much a factor in driver decisions as Horner was
Particular_Cod2005,2025-05-14,"Horner and RBR / Toro Rosso also bought many more drivers to the grid to give them a shot than Toto over has though. Yes, RBR demand results, but they give a fair crack if you've got the talent. 

I mean; Sainz, Max, Albon, Gasly, Tsunoda, Hadjar, and Lawson are all on the grid (which is 35% of those currently on the grid, if my maffs is correct) thanks to Horner."
salcedoge,2016-10-03,"RBR is definitely more trigger happy with firings but imo it's a result of having more drivers to choose from.

Merc pretty much had Bottas on 1 year yearly contracts and their homegrown talent George who is literally performing at such a high level is still in risk of getting axed."
Hailgod,2012-07-01,redbull fires a lot but also brings a lot of talents into f1. many of them are now in other teams
Good_Air_7192,2022-01-09,I think that was mostly on Marko tbh
only_r3ad_the_titl3,2024-04-25,When has hormer bad mouthed his drivers???
only_r3ad_the_titl3,2024-04-25,"you mean like DeVries who got sidelined by Merc for years? And what about Vesti and Aron who didnt even get the chance to drive in f1 despite similar/better results than Lawson? 

If you promote more driver you also axe more drivers."
ClimateOk3630,2022-08-28,"I think not having Williams want to play junior team really threw a wrench into all of this tbh, but it's not like that's their job anyway"
UnluckyLuckyGuyy,2023-04-17,"No he didn’t? He got the most hate out of them all, people said he is in F1 because of his name, called him a nepo baby etc.

Nobody gave a fuck about Zhou. He was just driving around the back for 90% of the races but he didn’t crash so no one cared."
MindDependent1500,2023-02-13,"“Didn’t get much hate at all” He got hate every single race regardless of the results due to being compares by his father while driving a Haas under Steiner’s leadership. His costly crashes didn’t help and piled on more pressure from the media and fans alike.

Edit: misread the comment disregard this"
Driscuits,2024-11-26,"Yeah. It's a mental hurdle just *being* 18, let alone being 18 and having the weight of millions of dollars and thousands of people's work behind you and depending on your performance. Hell, when I was 18 I failed a biology paper assignment and was a wreck - I'm very, very glad that I didn't have media or fans watching me deal with the weight of my own expectations. 

Many things can be true - other rookies can deserve compassion, *and* we can have compassion for Kimi now. And, like you said, there's something to be said about expectations for 23, 24 year olds etc., and the amount of tools and experience they have available, and expectations we have for an 18 year old."
MindDependent1500,2023-02-13,Yep forgot about DeVries knew I was missing a name. He was much older than the typical F1 driver and without much backing. People came for his head when he drove the best he could in that shitbox of an AlphaTauri.
Mysterious_Turnip310,2021-09-04,"Bottas was under so much mental stress at Mercedes that he developed an eating disorder. He's spoken at length about the strain those continuous 1-year contracts put him under, and he was a damn sight more experienced than Antonelli is."
AlteredReality79,2016-11-28,You do know and realise everything changes in 26? Mclaren being clear this year doesn’t mean shit for next year’s development.
VenusDeMiloArms,2021-06-27,James Allison being able to design the car from the start when he's been one of the best in the game is huge. Alpine also will likely be great if their aero is that good. I don't know that McLaren is going to be a rocketship.
maton12,2015-02-05,Toto's one of the richest men in f1.  Money is no object and he thinks his best driver would be Max.
miathan52,2017-12-14,"There was this rumor at some point that Mercedes was ahead of the others with engine development based on an interpretation of a comment that Toto made about the new engine regs, and since overreacting is what the internet is best at, that became ""Mercedes is the place to be in 2026"""
Maus_Sveti,2016-09-03,"Not that I want Max to move, but there seems to be a lot of chatter in the paddock about Merc having nailed the engine for the next regs. Lest we forget that the engine was the main factor behind at least the early Merc dominance from 2014 on"
Falcao1905,2019-08-16,I want to say that Ferrari and Audi engines aren't as far behind as we think.
TopStar200,2024-04-03,Hopefully it is for George and Kimis sake.
Financial-Praline921,2020-10-31,yeah but mclaren will have the same engine and basically has  works deal with merc and has shown to have much better aero and tyre deg then merc this set of regs
Mysterious_Turnip310,2021-09-04,It is. Though the hugely enhanced engine deal McLaren negotiated for 2026 & beyond gives them. seat at the development table so Merc are close to having another works team with the same engine and (at present at least) a superior aero and development team to compete against.
Sarixk,2017-08-30,Clearly not here
Sarixk,2017-08-30,Ferrari maybe? Lewis is not under contract for 2027. I don't know if Ferrari would take Bearman instead though
newthhang,2017-05-19,After F4 he did FRECA and FRMEC and won both. The F2 PREMA was shit and that is why he wasn't up there fighting for a championship.
FormulaGymBro,2024-09-10,"I said this before he entered Mercedes, put Schumacher in the seat and put Antonelli in F2 for another season at least. 

Skipping F3 and getting P6/P7 in a Prema is not a good CV for a Mercedes seat."
666millionsofgoats,2016-05-22,I'm sure that's something we could have see if 2026 wasn't a regulation swing
FormulaGymBro,2024-09-10,I support my drivers  **¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**
Horat1us_UA,2022-06-04,Why are you so sure negotiations are about his seat tho?
Sad_Energy_,2024-09-03,Being supportive and also trying to get the best driver aren't mutually exclusive.
impelagato,2025-02-11,"Dude, rumors had it that negotations were about George's seat, George himself fueling the rumors to put pressure on Toto, and now all of a sudden you come up with your own rumor that in fact they were about Kimi's seat :/

C'mon be serious"
Any_Inflation_2543,2021-10-08,"The rumours are that Toto wants Russell-Antonelli while Källenius is desperately pushing for Verstappen.

Interestingly, it seems that if Verstappen was to come, Källenius would rather ditch Russell while Toto would rather ditch Antonelli. 

But I don't think Toto is very happy with Källenius trying to micromanage the team."
Ill-Barracuda7403,2024-09-19,It appears that Russell can't negotiate with other teams due to his junior contract with Mercedes and their management of him. Hence he has said several time recently that he has no control.
Any_Inflation_2543,2021-10-08,I honestly don't remember. The only semi-reliable source here (AMuS) is claiming that a breakthrough in Russell's contract talks had happened before Spa and the contract is about to be signed and announced.
newthhang,2017-05-19,"The people sending Doohan death threats were Argentinan fans and there were plenty of posts in support of Doohan here & because of this people also turned on Colapinto. I've never heard of Logan getting death threats, people felt for him when Wolves took his car and gave it to Albon (after Albon smashed his) - so much so that they hoped Albon doesn't score a point (which he didn't manage to do); for me, regardless of which driver it is - seeing someone in such distress feels bad and of course, you would want to encourage them, at the very least pity them. Those are human beings, not robots after all."
_Red_Knight_,2015-10-07,The people who were sending death threats to them are not the same people expressing sympathy for Antonelli.
MesmersCure,2023-04-04,"That's fair, you're right. I didn't consider Stroll's experiences when he was 18. I do think my point stands when considering Kimi's age in relation to the other rookies. I also think Kimi has had some bad luck which has compounded his lack of confidence. And while Kimi has a better car than the other rookies, he also has to deal with the increased pressure that comes with driving a the best car out of them all."
LosTerminators,2017-02-17,"He's had a lot of bad luck in all honesty as well. Not to mention that the car has fallen off and only works well under very specific circumstances regarding circuit layout, track temperature etc. Let's look at his last 7 races:

Imola - missed Q3, recovered back to 8th before DNF due to mechanical. Russell struggled and only finished 7th as well.

Monaco - crashed in quali and started 15th. With overtaking impossible, that ended any chance of points.

Barcelona - qualified 6th a couple of places behind Russell, and was running a comfortable 7th before retiring due to another mechanical failure.

Canada - car was rapid this weekend and he was incredibly impressive. Qualified 4th, gained a place at the start, pressured Max before the stops, held off both McLarens until they came together. Backed up Russell's win with a well deserved maiden podium.

Austria - outbraked himself into turn 2 on lap 1 and drove into Max, ending both their races.

Silverstone - team gambled and put him on slicks on a wet track early which turned out to be the wrong choice. Got taken out by an unsighted Hadjar and had to retire from damage.

Yes, he has scored only once in 6 races, but only two of those non scores were his fault."
GothicGolem29,2022-06-29,Hes 18 and a rookie it was always possible he was gonna have some bad races
Cosmocrator,2011-07-19,"Toto knew the risks: he could not risk Antonelli signing for a different team (like he lost a young Verstappen to the RB family), so he had to sign Antonelli before he was actually ready. Toto knows that he has to be patient with Antonelli and keep the pressure low. He will not drop him.  At least not for that reason. Only if he could sign Verstappen Antonelli would be in trouble, the same as Sainz when Ferrari could sign Hamilton."
ddthrow1233,2016-06-16,This is part of the problem in f1. If a team tries to give a young driver the chance to develop they get shit on because the rookies need time and obviously won’t be perfect and if they don’t they get called ruthless by the media and everyone says it’s unfair. It’s a no win situation for them. Dropping kimi would be a huge mistake imo
MC897,2019-05-29,Perhaps he just needs to be left alone?
swannyhypno,2022-03-03,He's an 18 year old rookie and started the season excellently he needs time
InevitableSouth122,2025-06-18,"It just feels like that but in the past 6 races(not counting spa), he’s gotten unlucky 3 times. 2 Engine DNFs and 1 time Hadjar crashed into him. Each time he was in a position to get points. In the other 3, he got a podium, crashed into max and crashed in Q1 in Monaco."
NileCrocodile666,2025-04-13,"He’s doing better than most of the rookies. He’s seventh in the driver standings. Only behind the lies of Hamilton, Leclerc and Russel. Considering it’s his first season I’m not sure how that’s meh."
fire202,2020-04-13,"Verstappen is staying with Red Bull for the moment, so that shouldn't be a concern for him. Maybe next year.

If he doesn't impress in the longer run, his position will eventually come into question, that's F1. But a few bad results in his rookie year won't fundamentally change things."
JustLikeZhat,2021-07-28,I can always count on you having the worst/funniest takes on here. Thanks for making me laugh :)
Messipus,2011-09-09,"Lmao, what? People really do just pull shit out of their ass."
Loightsout,2020-12-09,You see the post is about Kimi Antonelli right?
Affectionate_Sky9709,2023-02-10,"It was, but after they shortened a DRS straight passing has gotten quite difficult. I hope the drivers still like it, but I think the sprint showed that overtaking with equal tires in dry conditions is nothing like it used to be."
fetus_mcbeatus,2024-09-01,"Max is literally 9 years older than kimi and vocal about wanting to try other forms of racing so he won’t be here forever. 

If Toto gives up 9 more years of potential greatness in exchange for a few years of a proven winner, I would lose all respect and confidence in Toto and Mercedes. 

I like George, but he’s the one who will be packing his bags. 

(George to Williams, Lewis retires and Sainz back to Ferrari 🙏)"
Any_Inflation_2543,2021-10-08,"I think it would only happen if Max were to join. Otherwise Merc is staying with George + Kimi. 

The question over Max is an interesting one as Toto seems to prefer Max + George while Källenius apparently wants Max + Kimi."
VenusDeMiloArms,2021-06-27,"There is no way he goes back to F2. He needs to stay at Merc and do well if he wants to keep a spot in a top team. There's no universe where he debuts at the top team, gets demoted to a customer team, and returns. He can hope to kill it at Alpine and maybe go to Ferrari."
aipitorpo,2020-01-24,"You are essencially sacking one rookie to protect another then, because for some reason Kimi deserves time and Colapinto doesn't."
buffa_noles,2019-10-02,">but realistically only one of them would escape that season with top team credentials outside of it being even

This would be a plus for everyone involved. Ferrari gets their Leclerc heir apparent & Haas likely gets a stable situation with a young lead driver for their team to build around, similar to Albon/Williams"
jaysvw,2018-10-05,"Your average r/formula1 user thinks any time a TP makes even the most benign suggestion that their driver could do something better is akin to ""bad mouthing"" or being a meanie or whatever."
sfcindolrip,2021-08-06,"These are old examples, only because I’ve tried not to think about Horner much recently. 

Yuki: In the 2021 title fight, tsunoda inadvertently blocked max on a flying lap at Mexico. The quote horner gave to the journalists was that “max got tsunoda’d.” tsunoda then proceeded to receive a deluge of internet threats and harassment  

Gasly: In the first half of 2019 there were weekly Horner quotes for public consumption about how Gasly needed to be racing Ferraris and mercs, not saubers. How Horner thought he (Gasly) really needed to use his summer break to reflect and get his head right to start finishing further ahead. 

Checo: He was very mild in his criticism of checo, focusing on how Red Bull was really hoping he would regain form so that they could seal the constructor’s. That said, if Toto were giving quotes every week about how the team needs Kimi to find form so they can surge ahead of Ferrari and secure p2, I think people would say he was harping on about it a bit much, it isn’t something Kimi doesn’t already know, and it’s pointless to keep bringing it up publicly. 

Ricciardo: nothing readily comes to mind other than saying Ricciardo leaving for Renault was running from a fight. Something we all knew to be true.did it need to be said, there’s probably room for all manner of opinions on that. 

So I think it’s fair to say Horner doesn’t routinely slag off current RB stable  drivers or rip into them like Marko…..but there are times when he comments on their poor performance more (or more directly) than absolutely necessary. “We’re poring over the data, we’re committed to finding a solution, we know he’s capable of more than this and we feel we owe it to him to help unlock that performance” - these are more positive, non-quote-generating deflections than opining weekly on fighting for a WCC with one car. The driver in question is already acutely aware their poor performance is affecting the whole team — including staff morale and bonuses for example."
swannyhypno,2022-03-03,Well when they replaced Logan last year I said Merc should've just let Kimi goto Williams to get experience ready for this year
FormulaGymBro,2024-09-10,Which is the right call. Williams won't be fighting for P5/P4 while one of their drivers is a junior.
FormulaGymBro,2024-09-10,Mick has a lot of support and a lot of (unjustified) hate. He is much more in the spotlight than other drivers who remain under the radar.
NotOkEnemyGenius,2023-02-22,re-read that post
braapstututu,2016-02-29,Wasn't that more because the rules minimum weight was too low which encouraged drivers to be lower weight. Iirc rosberg even stopped cycling to lose a kilo of leg muscle in 2016 because of the advantage.
forst76,2017-08-10,"Still, there's no guarantee that next year's Mercedes will be better than Red Bull. Or Aston Martin. Or Ferrari. Moving teams now is a huge risk for everyone."

Any_Inflation_2543,2021-10-08,They manage him to an extent apparently. And dropping him and then not allowing him to get a seat would destroy the Mercedes academy. Nobody would choose such a path.
aipitorpo,2020-01-24,The same people expressing sympathy for Antonelli are the ones that are calling for Colapinto to be replaced. Zero sympathy there.
Halkatlaa,2017-10-23,"I agree with you! 
Just pointing it out that Lance back in 2017 was this kid and half way through the season he had the same things Kimi has now. 
1 podium and a front row start (yes I'm counting the sprint)"
Blurandski,2015-12-16,"In races yes, but since Miami he's not come within a quarter of a second of Russell in race qualifying, and averaging .39s behind.

The thing that's worrying me is that while the first two races were a free hit, Japan-Miami he showed some pretty decent pace and looked to be on an upward trend (avg .20 behind), but since then he's gone into reverse - and that's as he's become more familiar with the car and is on tracks he has lots of experience on.

I suspect the concern in Brackley is shifting from whether he can challenge Russell to whether he's stuck in the Gasly/Albon doom loop (seeing themselves drop four tenths to their teammate, push harder, end up in the wall/gravel, lose further confidence in pushing the car, losses more speed and repeat)."
Freeze014,2016-03-17,when was the race where the RBR team sent Verstappen into his side and he had to do an extra lap...
LosTerminators,2017-02-17,"I don't think his initial plan was to bring in Antonelli for this year, but after Lewis decided to leave for Ferrari he had a vacant seat.

With James and Williams making it clear that they won't be a development team, and no top driver that would be willing to take a 1 year deal, Merc fast tracked Kimi in."
GiantT-Rex,2025-07-01,Or maybe he was promoted way too early?
SkilledPepper,2023-04-26,"I'm not saying drop him and I think some people need to tone down the criticism. However, calling his start to the season ""excellent"" os also exaggeration just in the opposite direction. He's been decidedly mid amongst the rookies. He's looked better than Colapinto, Doohan and Lawson but  Hadjar, Bortoleto and Bearman have shown more promise so far."
GiantT-Rex,2025-07-01,"He is too young to be in F1. At least, for his current ability. A good start means nothing if the whole season is mediocre."

I support the guy and want him to do well, but he's still an unknown about his full potential. Most of his success was in unlimited testing series, and he was a crazy high tester. Like Freddie Slater now, I watch him and wish him so much success, but we won't really know until he's in limited testing series. And Kimi even got 20+ days of GP2 car testing and 30something GPs worth of testing before those years started. We still have to see how Kimi turns out.

I think another year of George Kimi is great. We'll see after that."
Blurandski,2015-12-16,"Verstappen level talents don't get dominated like Antonelli is over a full season. He has time to turn it around but it's all going in the wrong direction at the moment & Wolff knows that - you only need to listen to his preseason comments and his comments through the season (e.g. ""Kimi brings the youthful energy, George brings the laptimes"") to realise that AKA has not so far lived up to the benchmarks Merc will have set."
FormulaGymBro,2024-09-10,Zero chance George leaves Mercedes.
Blurandski,2015-12-16,"Yeah, for various reasons I really don't believe Verstappen is on the move this year, I guess the question is how bad can it get before Wolff feels like he needs to do something - if his confidence is really lacking in the car then his times will start slipping back further. which could trigger a reckoning.


Even if Verstappen did move - I just refuse to believe a driver handing out a Vandoorne level beatdown to a hyped rookie would get dropped. It makes no sense on a sporting level."
DontGetBanned6446,2025-03-24,"If it was up to r/formula1 we would have a grid of 20 of the most mediocre drivers you can find and everyone would be praising them because it's mean to criticise them, and they're in no danger of getting replaced by someone with more potential because ""they just need more time 🥺""."
ClimateOk3630,2022-08-28,"I'm just not convinced James was ever seriously considering taking Kimi. We now have receipts that he was quite literally courting Carlos as early as 2023, and I'm pretty certain that if Carlos hadn't signed he would've probably gone through with either keeping Franco (which looks good for the Williams academy, and Franco was performing much better at the time than he is now) or signing Esteban, who I think had a seat fit with the team before ultimately choosing Haas."
MindDependent1500,2023-02-13,Thanks for the correction disregard my previous reply
Mysterious_Turnip310,2021-09-04,"It may have played a part but he said himself that it was a form of control for him over something when he felt he had so little. Which is not at all uncommon with an eating disorder. He also, as I said, has talked at length once he left Mercedes about the constant strain those contracts put him under.

eta: I think even the most aware of us fans can't imagine the mental stress these guys are continually under. The F1 paddock is known as one of the most mentally brutal arenas in sport for a very good reason. Most of us would either walk away or would crumble in a heartbeat (and I include myself in that)"

d-o_oI,2025-02-19,"In fairness, Russell has been on a tear trying to deflect the Verstappen rumors, so some of that drop might just be Russell stepping up, not Kimi falling off."
MechaniVal,2017-08-23,"Miami, his Sprint pole. He lost the lead near the start but was doing fine until the pit torpedo. Still recovered into the points though!"
Farlig_Raptor,2016-05-22,He would’ve been fine imo if he wasn’t driving for a top team against a top driver. Put him in any of the other rookies seats and I believe he would flourish.
Frequent-Coyote-1649,2020-08-29,...Has Bearman really been that much better? Sure he's fairly close to Ocon but basically all of Haas' best results come from Ocon. Bearman also started the season brilliantly bar the practice spins in Australia but it seems he is running out of steam by now. They've been basically equals imo.
Fredderov,2011-07-26,That's not just true for rookies as well. It's really the core of any F1 driver comparison.
swannyhypno,2022-03-03,I would say Borteleto over Bearman tbh

LosTerminators,2017-02-17,"> Verstappen level talents don't get dominated like Antonelli is over a full season.

Even Verstappen himself was behind Riccardo more often than not in his first two seasons at Red Bull. And he had a full year's experience with Toro Rosso before driving for Red Bull."
GothicGolem29,2022-06-29,Except they could when their 18 years old in their first season
MechaniVal,2017-08-23,"Verstappen didn't beat Ricciardo in the Red Bull until 2018, when he was in his *fourth* season, and Russell is at least as good as Ricciardo was.

Antonelli has had 2 mechanical DNFs from solid points positions, as well as the Hadjar shunt in Silverstone, the Verstappen pit punt in Miami, and some dire strat calls (like the call that put him next to Hadjar in the first place).

I wouldn't expect him to be consistently beating anyone ahead of him in the championship, and the excessive size of the points gap to Russell is basically a combination of Russell's stellar form right now and Antonelli's awful luck. He's only made a handful of his own errors and is doing quite well otherwise."
NendoroidAshe,2019-07-19,I thought they might have gone after Bottas
swannyhypno,2022-03-03,It only would've been a loan and could've helped get even cheaper engines or parts from Merc but it ended well there team lineup is great
Any_Inflation_2543,2021-10-08,Yeah. I'm saying there are rumours about either of them being replaced.
aipitorpo,2020-01-24,There are tens of people on this thread suggesting that Kimi should drive for Alpine next year to help them develop. That's pretty much calling for Colapinto to be replaced.

Lov3ll,2013-11-03,"Hamilton: Are they still ahead by a minute?


Adami: Gentlemen, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us ‘take a monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.’ Thirty years later, Sebastian told us ‘I had to start my car like a computer, it’s very complicated.’ And Nico Rosberg said that during the race – I don’t remember what race - he pressed the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you both: is Formula One driving today too complicated with twenty and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning the technical programme during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more communication with your engineers?"

- It allowed the front 5 to pull away & once they were well ahead, nothing really happened at the front.

- It secured 6th for Hadjar, which benefitted Ocon too.

- Screwed over the very early pitters (e.g. Tsunoda, Bearman)

- Created the weird Williams/Mercedes situation which Williams were always in control of."

Correct

It should have been. A mechanical failure is such a shame when it was basically guaranteed. You called jinxing it though, that's half points. I'll call that a 62.5% overall. Decent passing grade. Hope Paris is wonderful."

doskkyh,2018-04-08,"Palmer and Alex Brundle saying there should be a joker lap is one of the takes I ever heard.

Monaco needs a solution to make racing possible. They have a huge bay area and the city is constantly claiming area over the water to build stuff. If they wanted they could claim some of the bay area to improve the section after the tunnel to make overtaking more likely. That's a solution, everything else is a band aid fix."
Le_Pistache,2017-10-23,"Not sure what to make of this race.

The additional stop did make the strategy battle more engaging at face value, but in the end we got the same 10, just with Alonso out with a power unit failure and Hamilton passing Hadjar in the pits.

VCARB and Williams just had a lot of control considering their track positions. They both pulled off the stops they were able to forge themselves brilliantly. Williams doing a switcheroo at Albon's second stop was honestly quite superb.

Mercedes were a bit ridiculous. Russell threw that strategy out of the window with a stupid decision to cut the chicane, but there was really nothing they, Sauber, and the individual other cars below VCARB and Williams could have done about it. The back up the pack strategy is too strong.

Otherwise Norris delivered a big win when he needed to do it. Three points separating the duo with Verstappen still lurking. Surely soon we will have a wheel to wheel battle between the two."

monaco just isn't going to produce on track racing in the dry. The only way to shake up the results in the dry is with some divine intervention of safety cars or pit stop mistakes. The 2 stops thing at least gave something to talk about, but I would be surprised if they did it again. guys were driving too slow for there to be a real chance of incidents anyways"

Reebz0r,2019-04-15,"Many people call Monaco boring, I call it frustrating. Good racing is so tantalizingly close, but the cars are too big and need so much room to stretch their legs. Monaco is too short, sharp and narrow for this current spec and likely the next one. 

Nice experiment but the mandatory two stop was ultimately a fruitless endeavour, and I'm not in favour of more contrivances like mandatory pitstop windows. The more you try to manufacture an outcome the worse it gets. It might have added to the intrigue and the drama, but ultimately was detrimental to the on-track product.

Worried_Ebb6069,2020-11-04,"Monaco should just be a qualifying race. Basically a full day to put the best laps or give each driver three laps to put in a qualifying time.

jdowd51,2019-11-11,"The fact that Spa is being considered as a track that would be rotated in or out in a season and this shit gets to stick around is amazing. Cant wait for whatever special rules they create for next season to spice up the “racing.” Keep Imola around at this point. History cannot be the only reason why this race stays on the calendar. Don’t blame the size of the cars either, big or small, it’s always been a very difficult track to pass on. Say what you want about three races in the USA, at least those races are entertaining."

nahnonameman,2020-04-09,"Interesting race. 

I am convinced if Max was not in the Red Bull, that car would running P19 and P20 and be last in the constructors 

Ferrari did something and I happy nothing bad happened. 

McLaren is dominant 

Mercedes I am hoping for a comeback"

RayneShikama,2016-05-10,"Dude what the heck happened to Williams? I know Carlos was already having an up and down season but was gaining momentum and even had four straight points finishes at one point. And the first third of the season Albon finished in the points in 7 of 8 races— with the one outlier being a 12th at Bahrain. 

But since Monaco Albons now got three straight DNFs and the Sainz deal today. I really hoped they were going to keep improving but they’ve just fallen off a cliff."

Seven2572,2018-01-11,"Driving standards of 50% of the grid seem pretty awful currently. Yuki (yes the car is bad to drive) has not developed his racecraft at all in his years of F1 it seems, he is always losing a front wing end plate on someone. Colapinto on Piastri was embarrassing. Stroll I won't even get into. Both the Haas' and Racing Bulls seem to have a high chance of a ding dong at some point during any race. You shouldn't have to race for over a decade to be able to consistently drive wheel to wheel with someone."

Colapinto was informed by his engineer about Piastri immediately behind and the blue flags immediately before the braking zone when he was fighting Yuki. He was informed about 7 seconds before he almost ended Oscar's race.

Team did everything right there. 100% Colapinto's fault for shit track awareness."

HangYourSecrets,2013-09-22,"I love Oscar and he did great, don’t get why people think McLaren is tilting it for Lando. It’s the consistency that’ll get him this WDC. But if Lando gets his consistency down and gets it that’s just on merit."

Verstappen has also been unlucky to a lesser degree this season. So when I saw Antonelli literally teleporting at the race start I had a feeling Verstappen was going to be in the danger line. Hope they get some good races coming up.

Other reactions - 

Bortoleto finally in points!! It was only a matter of time for him but really happy it's finally happened. 

Last time I saw Alonso looking this happy was in 2023? Brazil 2023 iirc? Super happy to see him celebrating Bortoleto's achievement 

Yuki heartbreak

Mercedes really needs an air conditioned tracks. If F1 is a winter only sport George is WDC

The opening duel was quality stuff: Oscar pushed Lando hard for 18 laps, and Lando didn’t put a foot wrong, not even at the start and he was impressive in the duel with Oscar he let him past in the best place and then retook the position back. Great respect from the both of them also.

Ferrari ended up best of the rest, more because Mercedes imploded. Kimi was gone immediately thanks to a ridiculous move at lights out, and the car just melts in the heat. It’s more a contest of who wants to lose P2 in the championship than who’s earning it.

Lawson did great. Only Red Bull driver to score points, lol.

Bortoleto was driver of the day. Scored points, amazing in qualy yesterday and then got absolutely schooled by Alonso in the final laps to get the experience he needs. 

Hulk in the points too, which says a lot. That Sauber is legit. Three races in a row in the points, it’s no longer luck. The car is solid, and the dev team is clearly doing their job. Strategy game has been on point too.

Red Bull is looking like they’re on suicide watch. If they lose Max, they might as well join Alpine at the back of the modfield.

All in all, great race start, but kinda fizzled out at the end."

Forgotthebloodypassw,2025-01-25,"Glad to be streaming this one, a lot of dullness but:

Did Max hit the gaming kit during the race? As DC put it (I think) he didn’t have time to sweat this time.

The Sauber front right pit man has a serious case of restless-leg syndrome, and was pumped - fist bumps all round - a great result for the team and Bortoleto especially.

Lewis says he can stay out, then sets the fastest lap. A bugger for him - best result of the season and about two minutes of screen time.

Piastri and Colapinto are going to have words.

Yuki is in serious trouble, but as a development driver it was a good race. I’m expecting a move to Formula E.

Stroll needn’t bother either. At this point the new sponsors should point out that a one-driver team sucks.

Coulthard on Norris: “You’re a handsome man, a multi-millionaire, and driving one of the fastest cars on the circuit, relax.""

Alonso - I’m racing, sorry Oscar.

And Papaya Rules saved this grand prix."

Le_Pistache,2017-10-23,"McLaren dominated this race which was previewed yesterday when they were in a league of their own throughout qualifying. 

Norris with the best weekend performance he could have delivered after the last round. Dominant in qualifying and kept Piastri behind the entire race. His defense against him throughout that lap was excellent and decisive. 

Ferrari weren't at their level but clearly second best. Mercedes were nowhere. Poor move by Antonelli at the start.

Great race from Lawson and Alonso to pull off that one stopper to finish 6th and 7th respectively. I thought Sauber didn't quite react timely enough to their track position with Bortoleto.

But Bortoleto and Hulkenberg both had a strong race and result regardless. Props to Nico after a rather poor qualifying to get that result.

Ocon gets a points finish as his experience on Sundays tend to show over Bearman who makes little mistakes that cost him time. It will come with experience...

Alpine were quite bad today. It didn't seem that they could go fast on any tyre.  The less said about Williams the better. The good thing is that the next race weekend is right around the corner, so they can move on quickly from this one.

Good race even though the finale didn't go as anticipated."

The battling between these two was peak F1 today, loved it.

CabbageTheVoice,2013-06-18,"I think you can't just do that with every car. It's not that Max adds some pace to the car or whatever.

But It seems that RBR built a veeery ""narrow"" car, in that it can reach a very high performance but the tradeoff is that it is incredibly unstable. Max is able (perhaps through quick reflexes, fine senses or instinct) to keep the car in this narrow window consistently, allowing him to go a whole race with the car at very good performance.

If you can't consistently stay in that window and are in danger of slipping outside of it every once in a while, it will mean that you will probably go off track, land in a wall or make other mistakes. 
If that happens multiple times, you will automatically have to drive 'safer' in order to not crash out of a race. 

This is (I THINK) what the other RBR drivers are having to deal with. It's not that their usual pace is MILES off of Max, but that they can't drive to the limit of _their_ pace, as the car will lose consistency because they can't keep it in that narrow window as well as Max can. 

Basically, in gaming terms: RBR is a glass-cannon build and Max was grinding no-hit runs. 

Now, Max probably still also has some pace advantage over at least some of these drivers. So if you were to put him in an Alpine for example, it could be that he would fare better than their current drivers. 
But I would wager that he won't suddenly be in the top 3 just like that, as those teams haven't developed their car around Max's consistency, so they don't have such a high peak in the first place, and probably went for more of a more consistent car with a little less peak performance.

I am an armchair expert, everything I just said could be entirely wrong!

Le_Pistache,2017-10-23,"I don't think I've felt this happy for a driver in a long time. Gasly at Monza 2020 the last one.

Incredible from Hulkenberg, especially as he kept Hamilton behind when it looked so precarious. Lewis and co pitted a lap or two too early for dry tyres to be effective. Allowed a manageable gap and that's when it sank in that Hulkenberg was going to do it after 15 years. It was incredible and I am glad the terrible takes based on that stat are put to bed.

The Piastri incident is interesting. I think how quickly he braked on a wet track earned him that penalty. It was quite abrupt when you consider the location and conditions. 

Not Norris' finest win and the penalty liked robbed us of a fight for first as he was gaining on him. Don't know how Piastri reacts to that however.

Hulkenberg and Sauber will deservedly get all the plaudits, but Gasly was superb dragging that Alpine up there all weekend long.

Aston's clever thinking got Stroll in the mix just like Sauber with Hulk, but he dropped off quite rapidly. Reckon they wish Alonso was there instead. 

Terrible race management from Mercedes. Both drivers also struggled. Leclerc uncharacteristically poor.

Can't believe the next race is in three weeks. Terrible scheduling with the summer break right around the corner."
GoodGuyJeff00,2023-08-26,"Lewis did what he could and Charles had a stinker with the pre-start call that ruined his entire race, also with the amount of safety cars coming out to keep cooling his tyres and not clearing enough water.


New suspension coming up. Make or break moment in Spa, which hopefully sends a good foundation for 2026."

I've been very critical of Lando at times, but he's kept his cool in this double header, and that's what wins you titles. These were a fantastic two weeks for him after a self-inflicted defeat in Montreal. 

There's a lot of twists and turns left to go in the season, but if this becomes a pattern for Lando, this is gonna be a tasty fight to the finish."

Hamilton was on a mission but those last two turns were a slight struggle. Looks faster than Leclerc this weekend, we will see if that continues tomorrow.

Bearman and Gasly were superb. What a shame that easily avoidable and stupid mistake in free practice 3 is going to cost Bearman so much given that he has that performance in him this weekend. He knows it though.

That means P8 for Gasly, but Alpine's race pace has been concerning lately. Will be some effort to maintain a points finish."

PLTConductor,2023-07-06,“We went motor racing Max” from GP hahaha
AliceLunar,2024-07-13,Even ended up behind Russell again.. with a clean S3 he at the very least would be P2.
Jazim94,2015-12-05,Could also be said he destroys his tyres to get up there before the last few …
TheWebbFather,2020-05-09,Everyone in the comments have blamed both drivers?
bimbobiceps,2015-12-10,"Didnt everyone have a bad corner. Ferrari boys suffered the most in that last corner. Before the final turn, Leclerc was 2nd in the timings."
Ottervol,2016-06-11,Can’t even watch the replay of quali yet. Only ESP is up.
Bourbonaddicted,2020-03-25,average rbr weekend
Ok-Average-3672,2021-02-05,"I think we all know the RB is pretty shit this year. I think it's unbelievable that Verstappen is pretty much the only one who can give McLaren a hard time, even tho it's a papaya rocket ship this year, and Red Bull might not even have the third best car."
cmgriffith_,2018-09-02,Almost like he’s the best driver on the grid
[eliminado],,It might be possible. The whole point of the low DF setup was to make sure it was very difficult for Max to be overtaken.
RacingGrimReaper,2021-12-01,Some rain would also be nice
scootsscoot,2015-07-04,As if he needed any more leverage lol
crazydoc253,2017-05-17,"This is clear and normal communication. He asked if he can go for another lap, the engineer said no because like most they fueled minimum needed for the lap. Having more fuel would cost time particularly when they were used softs. Hamilton did not improve on the second run on used softs why would he have improved on the third one ?"
the__distance,2014-03-25,Another incredibly dysfunctional ferrari communication there. Hamilton needing to ask the obvious follow up question again because they don't give him enough detail on the initial communication
Environmental-Cup445,2020-12-08,"Historically, P2 gets quite a good start around here. P2 starting Verstappen in 2022 took the lead from Sainz, and P2 starting Norris took the lead from Max in 2023, with 2021 and 2024 still being close. 

So P2 is a good spot for Oscar to start, I’m just happy he outqualified Lando otherwise I’d be worried Norris is just going to mop the floor with him in quali for the foreseeable future"
_EDM_,2012-06-13,"Cover, a McLaren wins the race I think."
ppnexus,2023-08-29,"its risky to go out so late, someone could have easily crashed and fucked everyone else's laps. Max went for a risk and luckily it worked out."
DMC_addict,2021-02-10,"Honestly should be teammates next year, I’m here for the drama"
Consistent_Squash,2020-07-12,Totally agreed. Wish the WDC fight was between them

VCBeugelaar,2014-06-21,With Max on the front row? In the rain?
stupidfock,2022-01-27,I mean it’s still the best pair
MoosilaukeFlyer,2025-06-01,"He probably does. Verstappen is obviously the best in the world, but Piastri and Norris are miles ahead of Tsunoda. Maybe Ferrari has a better pairing but that’s the only team with an argument (A weak one at that)"
Easting_National,2016-09-05,it might not be a good car but it clearly aint a tractor
sbenfsonwFFiF,2024-03-20,"That’s no tractor lol, just hard to drive"
jelmer130,2018-04-15,"It was really, really stupid, but I am quite happy with the penalty they gave him.

A 10 place grid penalty is quite a big penalty, especially in this case. Bearman qualified P8 (best of the rest) for his home race. It would have been an amazing result (still is of course), but instead he starting nearly last in P18.

In addition, I can't remember if the stewards ever handed out 4 penalty points for 1 offence. He doubled his penalty points and is getting somewhat close to a race ban.

I think he is really angry with himself at the moment, and I hope that he will learn from this."
Velveteen_Rabbit1986,2025-05-15,"Definitely rain in the forecast tomorrow, guess it's whether it hits at race time or not (my forecast says it'll be over by then but I'm sure when I check tomorrow that will change)."
jyw104,2014-02-21,The only way that Red Bull could go toe to toe with the Ferrari and McLaren cars was to go low downforce. He was on the limit. Great lap.
Darth_Spa2021,2024-09-22,Watch his pole lap. He is fighting to keep the car steady almost the whole time.
Aviator8989,2011-03-07,"The car can be built around Verstappen and he can also be the best driver on the grid.

And the ""so what?"" is that there's a 2nd car & driver that they've been completely neglecting if that is the case. By all means that's their choice. But when they are not at all in the conversation at all for the Constructors championship and the best driver on the grid is barely staying in the conversation for the Drivers championship; it's absolutely fair to criticize their car design strategy."
Public-Research,2019-12-31,"Just ask those people, why are the other teams NOT building their cars around their drivers?"
Visionary_Socialist,2021-01-07,My heads absolutely gone he fully did a Raikkonen and blew S3. At least Max blowing everyone away makes it feel a bit less certain it would have been enough.
JustRecentlyI,2016-10-21,"He was a tenth off of Piastri even with the mistakes in the final few corners, if he got it perfect like Max did I don't know who would have ended up ahead."

highrouleur,2015-09-23,Exactly. It's scary how much better he's able to be
fantaribo,2016-11-03,"I disagree. He asked if they are at risk, and if they can go again.

The answer is precise enough: they are not at risk, and they need to box. 

Thing is, Lewis asks for more because that communication has already shown to be defective, and it's now too late to be normal."
Cute-Chemistry-2815,2022-05-17,"Yeah the communication between them is awful, he needs a new race engineer as we are now far beyond teething problems the relationship just isn’t working. But also why was he on track having completed a lap prior to even having the information that he only had fuel for one flying lap."

HoodLoxley,2025-04-29,"I think a better description would be to say there isn't a single driver on the grid that a smart team wouldn't replace with max, I think today cemented how incredibly good he is in my mind, that was fucking mental."

Le_Pistache,2017-10-23,"It was a fantastic race by Verstappen to frustrate the McLarens. He is simply excellent around Suzuka.

McLaren played it too safe. They can afford to when they have net gains on their rivals regardless, but still surprising to see given the options they had to play around with.

It seems like nobody wanted to go for free air when in losing positions. Red Bull should have pitted Tsunoda earlier to allow him to push on a bit.

I thought Antonelli was excellent. A well managed long first stint and he was flying during the second stint. Finishing a second behind Russell on your track debut is solid.

Good results for Hadjar and Bearman. Lawson was a bit slow on both his stints. A bit concerning on that front.

The race wasn't excellent unfortunately. The end could have salvaged it, but the tyres weren't falling off for anyone and McLaren couldn't get within DRS, with the midfield all settled after the stops. The anticipated delta to overtake was too high. Ah well, they happen. Onto next weekend..."

Good lord, Ferrari just are not in the fight this season it seems. Shocking to see Lewis lose a lot of ground to Kimi (who was on hards) on that second stint in mediums. Also, Charles was not a threat too. The notable Ferrari thing today would be the broadcasted radio messages.

StructureTime242,2023-06-21,Call this a boring race all you want but do not dare think Suzuka needs to go
EmergencyRace7158,2022-10-15,"Not a classic Japanese GP but I suspect we'll look back on this race and see it as a turning point in the WDC fight. My takeaways

\- This one was on Pirelli. They went way too conservative with the C3/2/1 tire selection. I suspect the C1 (hard today) could have done the full race distance with zero issues. A better selection would have been C2 (medium today) as the Hard, C4 as the medium and C5 as the soft.

\- Max is the favorite for the title. He's doing what he did in the 2nd half of last season and staying in touch while Red Bull improve the car. Yeah the RB21 isn't the McLaren but it's ahead of the Mercedes and Ferrari if they get the setup in the window - Suzuka is a fair benchmark for downforce and aero performance. Red Bull are widely expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the flexi front wing clampdown among the top 4 and if Max is within 25 points of the lead McLaren by Spain a 5th WDC is very much the expectation.

\- There's nothing between Oscar and Lando this season. They will keep taking points of each other as one or the other has a better weekend and this will play into Max's hands. Oscar threw away the pole and win with a mistake at T2 that cost him 0.3s on his final qualifying lap. I don't think McLaren could have won today regardless of strategy and they lost the race on Saturday.

\- Ferrari are a distant 4th fastest car at the moment. The China sprint pace was clearly from them running too low and they have some serious issues to sort out if they want to win races this year. They might be the first of the frontrunners to bin 25 and switch everything to 26.

\- Kimi continues to impress. Learned on track all weekend and performed when it mattered. He's going places fast and Toto has been completely vindicated in his move to promote him. Unless Max becomes available, this is the guy for Mercedes' future.

\- Yuki did okay. He was mostly just behind Max in terms of raw single lap pace but had a poor Q2 with Red Bull screwing him by sending him out on used softs first run and then making a mistake the second run. He'll be okay going forward in 25 but the pressure is really on for 26.

\- Hadjar had another really impressive outing and finally executed a full weekend. He has a lot of raw pace and needs to show he can deliver the consistency and maturity to bring himself into contention for a Red Bull seat in 26."
MyCoolName_,2017-11-16,It's only three races in but Oscar does look to have taken a step closer to Lando this season. Qualifying higher and showing pace more consistently in the races.
JFedererJ,2012-03-05,"McLaren are beyond dumb to not try an alt strat with one car and, imo, even dumber still to not let Oscar by when - with 10 laps to go - he was so clearly quicker than Lando.

Tsunoda showed he has speed but qualifying has to improve, an anonymous and incident free race was an ok debut.  


Getting Lawson back to VCARB was the right call, even getting VCARB'd every race does less psychic damage than being in that RBR.

iguled,2013-05-21,McLaren not leaving one of their cars out longer on the mediums was certainly a strategy
TalesFromTheGrid,2021-08-29,"A few thoughts from the race -

1) McLaren should have let Piastri have a go at Max, if he couldn't get it done then just swap them back.
2) Impressive drive from Hadjar as best of the rest.
3) Being out front in clean air is proving too much of an advantage given how the cars are affected by dirty air. Hopefully the new regs solve that.
4) As a fan, hearing that the tyres are thermal limited is not what you want to hear. It just means that drivers can only push for a few laps before they have to back off. I really think F1 need to look at tyres the drivers can push on all the time and then introduce mandatory stops. 
5) Good to see Kimi getting close to Russell, who once again barely featured in the coverage amusingly."

Arumin,2013-03-29,"> - There's nothing between Oscar and Lando this season. They will keep taking points of each other as one or the other has a better weekend and this will play into Max's hands. Oscar threw away the pole and win with a mistake at T2 that cost him 0.3s on his final qualifying lap. I don't think McLaren could have won today regardless of strategy and they lost the race on Saturday.

I think part is what might make this season like 2007.
McLaren have the best car, but they don't win the WDC as they take points off each other, leaving Max to take take it.

Kingdom818,2018-12-08,"Pitting on the same lap as Max wad inexcusable imo. Lando had good pace on the medium, but nobody was ever going to be able to pass without a tire offset. What happened at the pit exit was the best case scenario, overtaking in the pits would have been a very tall order.

If Lando would have gone long he could have potentially gotten a 10 lap tire advantage and had a chance to catch up and attempt a pass with an offset. (not how fast Antonelli was after his stop)

Maybe they wouldn't have won anyway, but they should have tried something because they were never going to win by pitting on the same lap."

Spockyt,2015-02-08,"I think you’re spot on about that. Mercedes were a bit complacent on strategy, so Red Bull learnt the skills to nab a win here and there, which serves them well now to turn a good result into a great one.

McLaren are in the mode of “let’s be happy with this good result” still, like they’re surprised to be P2, P3, rather than desperately trying to turn a P2 into a P1. Arguably they were better at that in the midfield, actually. Every now and then they’d pop up unexpectedly. Sainz a few times, Monza 21, Sochi 21, with Ricciardo and Norris for example."
