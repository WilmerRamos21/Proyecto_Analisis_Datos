I spend a small part of everyday doing a jigsaw puzzle.  It is so healthy for me, and has helped me cope with PTSD."

But my sister had just graduated college and that summer she figured we could try something that would introduce us to more people to socialize, and knitting was at the public library. I met a bunch of good people there, got a good coping skill, and eventually picked up crochet from the same people. (There was a lot of overlap in knitters and crocheters there.)"

Yrch84,2021-12-28,"Tabletop Wargaming.


I acutally rediscovered it after 10 years of hiatus.
Its Not the Hobby per se that changed me.
After being stuck in temporary Work in IT For years i got Back into Tabletop Gaming with 2 Buddies. My Job Made me sick and depressed because i never Had any true Job security.

Than a Chance to Work Part time at my local Games Workshop opened Up. So with Backup from my wife i quit and did that.

One year later i got offerd the Chance to manage my own Store and did that For about 4 years.
I learned about Management, Customer care, de-escalstion and got more self-consiousness to the Point i acutally enjoyed my Job again and being able to fight Depression. And i Made Tons of new Friends and Connections.

Then i went Back into IT but due to my experience with managing my Store, customers, inventory etc. I was able to jump into a higher Position.
Now im managing the Mobile Devices, Users and Network for our Towns schools, working with the Mayor and other politicians to get our schools from digital wastelands to modern systems.


So there is a good Chance If i never went Back into tabletops i would still do 1st lvl IT and hate life."

Every day ever since has involved me playing the instrument and I have gotten very good at it. Playing it has become my main outlet for stress and my life is richer."
FlyingVigilanceHaste,2022-10-25,"Video game preservation and documentation.

Covid was a funny time to get into things you might not have otherwise. I think the door to admission to some places was slightly more open/ajar than it would normally be and it allowed me to ‚Äúthrow myself‚Äù at the hobby.

Years later, it‚Äôs basically taken over any other hobby I once had. It takes up a lot of time but is incredibly rewarding."
VinceInMT,2024-05-26,Film photography.  While killing time in the military in the very early 1970s a friend took me to the post darkroom and when I saw the process it changed me forever.

CautiousCobbler2,2020-05-27,"Long distance running. I'm 100% convinced it helped me heal my PTSD, I still remember that first Marathon training block, during the long runs, when it gets really tough on the body my mind would revisit the car accident, my mum's death, and other traumatic events. Idk. There was something about pushing through the physical pain that allowed me to heal the emotional wounds.
Running makes me a much more mentally stronger person. I was very fragile, I had multiple suicide attempts, and I couldn't cope with stress and negative feelings in general. I can still struggle obviously, but I feel that running helped me develop the mental skills required to navigate life challenges more healthily."
magmaster32,2020-08-22,"Crocheting, something I picked up after my 1st baby.   When my grandma was still alive, she did all things crocheting, quilting, sewing and other needle work.    I have 2 very distinct memories  of her hobby, 1 was seeing how long of a chain she could crochet in a minute and the 2nd was when we made a ""spider web"" with a ball of yarn all though their  home, it was strung on the walls, lights, cabinets you name it.   I can now truly respect the love and patience they had for us to unravel an entire ball of yarn to just have to roll in back up by hand after we had our fun.  It makes me feel like she's still here when I pick up my current projects."
WanderingArtist8472,2024-08-14,"Bead Embroidery and r/MixedMediaArtJournals . I've been an artist all my life (over 50yrs)- done all kinds of artforms and hobbies. Also had done a lot of bead weaving and made beaded costumes, but when I discovered Bead Embroidery it really opened up my creativity.

Now I'm experiencing the same thing with the modern version of Mixed Media and Art Journals/Albums. I'm like a kid in the candy store with all the mediums and art supplies available now - colorshifting paints, die cutting machine in my home, all kinds of moulds, texture pastes, etc etc etc.... Back when I did Mixed Media in college we didn't have anything like this. Now I'm trying to incorporate my Bead Embroidery into my Mixed Media/Art Journals.

I forgot to say how I discovered it... With Bead Embroidery it was a book by Sherry Serafini and Heidi Kumli. I had been using beads in my belly dance costumes since 1988 and then got into bead weaving in the 90s. That bead embroidery book really changed how I approached making my costumes and making jewelry.

I found out about this new modern Mixed Media from paper craft companies - Stamperia, Mintay, Prima/Finnabair. The MxMd we did in college was boring by comparison! I use to use paint, collage & foils when I was in college... now I still use those along with resin/clay castings, die cuts, texture pastes - working on substrates that were never available to use back in the 80s - heavy black gessos, colorshifting paints... like I said, I feel like a kid in the candy store with all these mediums available now."
LeaveWuTangAlone,2014-07-16,"Hot yoga. I went with a friend at the beginning of what was to be a truly terrible, prolonged divorce out of an abusive marriage. I was so sick, miserable, worn down, zero confidence, an absolute shell of a human. 

After that first yoga session I joined the studio and went as often as I could. There were some classes where I‚Äôd just cry the whole way through‚Äîevery single posture with my face leaking like a waterfall.

About a year into it, I felt strong, empowered, more in control of my emotions and sense of agency. It completely transformed how I saw myself and what I was capable of. Now, almost 7 years later, I go to the yoga studio 5-6 days a week because i love it every time, and I don‚Äôt ever want to go back to that old version of myself."

WitchOfLycanMoon,2023-11-25,"Indoor plants. After an injury at work left me unable to work or live my normal life, I spiralled down into a depression and was borderline suicidal. I was on ""watch"" in my own home and I had no joy. I lost all my old hobbies. My doctor one day told me I needed to find something new and to Google ""hobbies that battle depression"" on YouTube. It put me onto plants. Changed my life instantly. Not only are they beautiful and I enjoy looking at them, I enjoy caring for them and watching them grow gives me satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment. They give me a reason to get moving even when I'm in horrific pain or groggy and dull from meds. They changed my life. My husband was so happy when I fell in love with plants and he saw the change that they created in me that he's been my biggest supporter and tells me all the time how proud of me he is. Over the years I've accumulated over 100 indoor plants and even started some outdoor plants as well like cacti."

I started archery because I had a crush on Legolas when I was young lol, but then during the course I‚Äòve learned that Archery is somehow a state of meditation. It‚Äôs the only time I can feel my mind and body aligned and in harmony with each other, and at the end I get rewarded with a lovely Dopamine boost from hitting the target! Never thought I was capable of doing this physically and mentally and was pleasantly surprised üòä it feels great to have a break from yourself sometimes."
Horror_Moment_1941,2024-03-05,"Antique radio restoration.... Came across an old Philco radio at a yard sale for cheap. I saw one in my grandparents house, many years ago. They are a perfect representation of years gone by. Each decade holds so much history. Great depression, WWII, ELVIS... 

So, learning small electronics, wood restoration and additional history lessons have been a refreshing change of pace. I'd recommend checking it out. 

P.S.A. NEVER plug in any old radio without first having it checked out."

Tried to make a business out of it and failed. Then I started making pinback buttons and mirrors with the button machine. I had a lot of fun until I thought maybe I'd make a business out of it.Now I have a button maker and supplies for sale. Recently, I taught myself to make different kinds of flavored popcorn and caramel corns and currently am working farmers markets on weekends. I have a really good full-time job so I don't know why I keep doing this. I tend to get obsessive and buy all of the materials. So right now in addition to the popcorn, I bling things with rhinestones. Nothing is safe in my house....."

Kishkumen7734,2022-02-19,"Battletech.  It's a table-top game played with miniatures and dice on a map.  Playing this game sharpened my number sense and vastly improved my mental math.    
It works like this:  
My 'mech (giant robot) walked 4 hexes.  The enemy 'mech moved six hexes into some light woods.  My gunnery skill is 4.  Add +1 because I walked.  Add +2 because the target moved 5 to 6 hexes.  The light woods adds another +1.  That's 8 total I have to meet or exceed with two six-sided dice.  But the target is medium range with the weapon I'm using, so I add another +2.  I have to roll a 10 or higher.

The target shoots back at me and adds +2 for running, +1 because I moved 4 hexes.  I'm at long range with his weapon so add another +4.  His gunnery skill is 4, so add all that together and he has to get an 11 or higher.

Once a shot hits, there's some damage rules and such, but adding up all these numbers and remembering who walked, who ran, where the trees are, the short, medium, and long ranges of weapons and then adding all this together improved my math ability more than school ever did.

If I had been aware of this game in 1984 when it was first published, I would not have had such difficulty in math class while in public school."

causa__sui,2020-05-11,"Scuba diving saved my life. In my early 20s I was gravely unwell - deeply, soul-crushingly depressed with treatment resistance and had survived two suicide attempts. My mom got me a gift certificate to get open water certified and I put it off for months until I figured I had very little to lose and may as well try it again (I‚Äôd been diving a few times as a kid and as a teenager). 

Diving forced upon me a sense of self-preservation. I thought, ‚ÄúThe only thing that stands between my life and death in the water is me‚Äù. When I was at my weakest point, it commanded me to stay calm, sharp, and mindful. I had to be prepared and self-assured. I had to trust myself. It was the strangest thing. It took me from being intensely suicidal on land to tenaciously protecting my life in the water. I still dive regularly to this day, it is my lifeline."
Maggie_cat,2012-11-27,"Body building. I learned how Whole Foods plays a role in gut health healing, and how to actually eat enough food for me. 

People tend to misunderstand body building. They think it‚Äôs steroids, starvation, body disorders and body dysmorphia‚Ä¶. It CAN be that when you don‚Äôt have a good coach who knows how to guide you. But what it did for me was heal my cptsd symptoms because I learned how to eat for my mental health and how to move my body through consistency. Discipline isn‚Äôt leaning when to say ‚Äòno‚Äô, it‚Äôs learning when to say yes AND no, and it‚Äôs not confusing the difference between between restriction and discipline.

Coincidentally, I got into it after having a terrible coach. I did my research and found a registered dietician who also coached prep athletes, and it opened up my eyes. I ended up getting my certified sports nutrition coaching cert, and I‚Äôm about to start a doctorate program where I‚Äôll be focusing on the link between gut health and mental health.

The biggest improvement is definitely in my mood and my wallet.

I always liked driving. When I first got my car, I would fill up my tank and just drove around the city to relax, listen to music or podcasts, scary stories, etc. and I did this for years. But just last year, yes, it took me that long, I decided that, if I'm going to be driving around for hours, why not just pick a direction and see what's that way."

I had this short term girlfriend who mentioned wanting to get into it. I was neither here nor there about it at the time. I ended up getting us both kayaks for her birthday and we took them camping and had a pretty good time. 

Well she ended up fucking me over pretty good. Wanted to break up but was super avoidant and non-confrontational about it so instead of talking about it with me and making it a transition she just put all my stuff outside and locked me out of the apartment we were living in. 

So I took both kayaks, a little out of spite. 

Now homeless, pretty much all I had were these two kayaks. So I lived in them for a couple of weeks. I‚Äôd paddle to an island, towing along my stuff in the other, set up camp and sleep in one with the other one on top. 

Soon I found a cheap little sailboat that I moved on to, and I‚Äôd anchor it out and use my kayaks to get to shore and back and commute to work. 

Years later I now live on a much bigger sailboat, have much better kayaks, and I guide sea-kayaking tours for a living. 

Kayaking is an absolute joy for me, and living on the water is a dream. I may have never known it if it weren‚Äôt for everything working out just so. I guess I owe my ex a thank you!"

My bf introduced me to pot when I was 17. I‚Äôm autistic and lived my entire life up until that point always feeling uncomfortable and anxious and overall just off. When I first got high I actually felt VERY comfortable in my body and I COULD EAT!!!! I always struggled with food so finally being able to eat until i was full ü§©ü§©ü§©. Oh and I could finally talk and carry a conversation like normal people do! I now start most of my days with a morning smoke while I feed the cats and watch them play.

I grew up with a mom that did a LOT of dog rescue (she now owns her own rescue dog transport business to take 30+ dogs to their furever homes twice a month. From Texas to Connecticut.) and with my autism I just really prefer hanging out with a fuzzy friend than with people. Animals also like me and warm up to me quickly. Anytime my mom got a foster that was pregnant or just really skidish and scared she‚Äôd keep them in my room. I‚Äôve had a litter of pups birthed onto my lap and dogs that would be sweet silly snuggle butts but only with me. 
I moved in with my bf when I was 17 and noticed a skinny female always hanging around the porch (Mama cat). Once I noticed her belly growing and realized she was pregnant I started putting food out for her. Since I provided a constant source of food she decided to give birth under the porch steps. My bfs mom found the kittens when they were old enough to be weened and we brought them inside. Kept 3 and sent the fourth to a foster who immediately adopted her on the first day lol. Well even after she had her kittens I kept giving her food because she seemed sweet enough to be tamed. Well all the food attracted the whole colony, especially pregnant mamas. My mom is friends with one of the few ladies that do cat rescue around here who owed her a favor and had her help me trap and fix a few. Most of the kittens that are born under our porch i socialize and send them up north with my mom to a rescue up there so the colony has stopped growing. Most of the males have left except for some of the grumpy old men and there is now only 2 females left to be fixed. One of the daughter of Mama cat who is kinda the oddball of her litter, all of her siblings were super sweet and friendly but she is absolutely feral. She runs up to me when she hears/sees me and meows at my feet and kinda pretends to rub on my legs without touching me and lets me know when she is pregnant or going into labor and calls me to her kittens so I can take care of them but she absolutely will NOT let me touch her. I‚Äôve tried trapping her before and now have some scars on my hands and right arm üò¨. She recently had another litter so once these little dudes are weened I‚Äôm going to try trapping her again and going to get her fixed. The other mama left to be fixed is princess. She stays around another one of the houses down the street that also put out food but not as consistently and only comes around to grab a quick snack or to show her kids where they can get a quick snack so my chances of trapping her are a big lower but I‚Äôm still going to try.

The unexpected side effect has been a profound impact on my mental health. Not sure if it's the baby break, the structure, the endorphins or what, but all mental health problems have shrunk/minimized greatly.

before we moved, my grandma had bought me a sewing machine for super cheap at an auction and it needed serious maintenance, so i tried to fix it. I sort of did, so i taught myself to sew and started making quilts. from there, i DIY-ed our first Christmas with all sorts of handmade things, got into community at church and started teaching others to sew from scratch, started a collection of sewing machines, new and old, and generally fell in love with making things by ""hand""

Yes it's technically exercise, but for me it is more of a hobby. Where in the past just going to the gym or for a run was not something I would sustain because it probably was not enjoyable for me lol and so I was doing it because we're supposed to exercise right.... When I finally committed to spending the money on myself to join a pilates studio I fell in love! I love the way my body feels and moves and it has totally changed my performance in life. I don't have to think about whether or not my body can perform whatever task I want or need to do because I know it can. And at the same time because of my studio I have met some amazing people who have become permanent fixtures in my life as well 

I literally get like an eye twitch or antsy if I go too many days without doing Pilates. I even bought some Pilates accessories so that I can do some Pilates exercises when I'm traveling even on vacation LOL"

But yes it did change my life for the good though I don't think I was supposed to see certain things but then I seen more and more. I am awake clear headed and now I watched 10 times more. Don't take anything for granted and don't believe anything that I see here or feel until I rationalize the situation and understand that it is there for me or for someone else. You will not know of this unless if it happens to you. But the ones who read this and know what I'm talking about totally understand what I'm saying and know that I don't have to say another word about it. But the ones who have never been woken up do not know what I'm talking about and that's okay. Staying awake means that you will be happy and living the American dream and you won't have to worry about much it feels great sometimes feeling like that. But once you see something you can't unsee anything ever again that goes for anything in life. Have a great life to you all be happy and enjoy what we have some people believe we only have one life if that's what you believe enjoy that life to the end if you believe in something else then enjoy that until it ends if it has a end.

I used to hate the wind, and though I loved to look at the ocean, I wasn't a huge fan of wading into the surf.

Then Sophomore year of college, I took a sailing class at MBAC (google it.)

Then I took another, then I got involved w sailing clubs, and crewed for some jaunty skippers.

Then I started racing monos, bought a cat, and really dug in to it.

Sailed in Australia when I lived there, have done it as often as possible since day 1 when I fell in love.

When I first got into running, I was in a bad relationship, and dealing with so much stress from that, my family, school, work. All of it.

While running obviously couldn't prevent the bad things, it so very much gave me the confidence and space to change my mindset, grow as a person, and learn to believe in myself after a childhood of being put down and being made to feel so small. I joke that it was my ""gateway sport"" - giving me the confidence (or delusions) to try all kinds of other activities, and discover nature in a new way, and allow a different kind of peace into my life.

There's really no good running places where I live now unless I want to drive to them and I have a young baby that I don't want to drag with me. My just for fun runs have been cut down a lot. I'm ordering a treadmill later this week. I'm hoping it helps me lose weight. Between medical problems and multiple pregnancies, I put on a *lot* of weight. I'm down 70ish pounds (100 total after gaining and losing from baby) in about a year of active losing. I have another 60ish to lose."

smarter_than_an_oreo,2020-03-11,"I used tetris to prohibit the onset of PTSD. My much younger sister and I were sleeping in our car at a trailhead late at night (multi-week road trip). We were parked next to telephone poles that were making that buzzing sound.

Around 1am a car came racing up and crashed heavily into a concrete barrier about 20 feet from our car. We had blinds everywhere so couldn't see anything. I could only hear when the brakes started screeching and I thought we'd be dead, either from the car hitting us or hitting the poles.

I honestly was terrified to get out of the car and see the damage, then I started hearing a girl screaming asking if someone was okay. I got out, the screaming girl was bleeding, I was hesitant to look inside the car but was relieved to see only one other girl, alive and not bleeding much. I called 911 and started helping in ways I could. It was difficult because the second girl was obviously high and hurt internally but wouldn't stop trying to move (you're supposed to stay still in case of spinal injuries)

It was a long night, ambulances, cops, fathers, just...everything. We were able to leave but still had to find a place to sleep (at 3am) and every car we heard, every tiny screech of a tire was just mortifying.

I literally forced my sister and I to download Tetris and start playing. What I had learned is they gave it to vets immediately after combat, whether that part is true I don't know, but I swear it helped and by the end of the trip we were fine. I have already had a near death experience and I'm still not okay after 7 years, but this event I'm completely fine without any therapy. I really think Tetris is the reason."

_maddiejean_,2019-06-17,"You're not gonna believe this, but object shows. They're a type of indie animation on YouTube and have gotten super popular since the creation of Battle for Dream Island in 2010 or so. After that, they exploded.

I found out about them in 2022 or so, and after a bit, I wanted to involve myself in projects that people were making, so I started auditioning for all sorts of shows. I've even auditioned for AnimationEpic (creators behind Inanimate Insanity) even when I didn't have the proper gear nor experience. (Kind of embarrassing now that I look back on it, but proud that I did it anyway even if I didn't have a shot). Most shows I've worked on never hit the public due to hiatus or canceling production (happens a LOT)--but I've gotten a few that are now out on YouTube and I've been so proud of my work since then. Could be the hyperfixation running in my head like a rabid animal, but I've been so in love with voice acting since starting my journey.

A couple of ways:

1. r/tipofmyjoystick is quite helpful for this and is already here on Reddit.
2. If you're cool seeking help on Discord, MobyGames has a channel specifically for helping find a game you can't quite remember. A few others are helpful in this regard as well:
   1. (MobyGames)https://discord.com/channels/300003816290648064/601812853003124740

   4. (RetroComputing)https://discord.com/channels/858192032795328522/858256546881863711
3. You can use groups within MobyGames to help find it. For example, if you know the game contains...
   1. Setting: Space station / Spaceship - [https://www.mobygames.com/group/12719/setting-space-station-spaceship/](https://www.mobygames.com/group/12719/setting-space-station-spaceship/)

4. IGDB's advanced search is also pretty nifty for this: [https://www.igdb.com/advanced\_search](https://www.igdb.com/advanced_search)
5. If you think the game was likely popular or highly acclaimed, you might just sort by popularity or rating and manually go through. SNES/Super Famicom doesn't have the largest library of games (under 1,500): [https://www.mobygames.com/game/platform:snes/sort:moby\_score/page:1/](https://www.mobygames.com/game/platform:snes/sort:moby_score/page:1/)

So I'll look for gold. If I dig up some relics, cool, if I find some gold, great, but it's a nice day out and learning about gold in the area, the 1850s gold rush, and about how to narrow down the search is cool.

Over the course of a couple of weeks it will train you to run 5k uninterrupted... If you start and you feel that it's still too hard on you, take a break for a while and start walking, walking, walking and then get back to it.. Trust me when I say, you can do this...

stabavarius,2021-08-15,"I had some ceramics classes and that was really neat. This is not just a pottery wheel, there are all kinds of hand fashioned things you can make. More like sculpture. I think stained glass is real cool, haven't tried this yet but I will soon."
GrinagogGrog,2021-11-02,"Aquascaping. Obviously you are getting pets, too, which makes it almost not a hobby, but a *pretty* tank? Nothing more satisfying."
moimoisauna,2020-03-10,"I feel like nobody ever talks about pouring resin on here. There's two types afaik- epoxy (2 part) for larger projects, and UV resin for smaller projects. It's a liquid that, upon curing, hardens into a glassy like plastic. Always pour in a well ventilated area because fumes. It gets pretty hot when curing, too."

LynnChat,2020-02-07,"You haven‚Äôt mentioned any of the fiber arts; sewing, needlepoint, embroidery, felting, thread painting, knitting, crochet.

Also paper arts; paper mache, quilling, origami, book or paper making, upcycling old books."
Nithoth,2022-10-04,"Scrimshaw is a low cost hobby. You need horn, bone, or fake ivory (which can be a bit spendy), something really pointy, some ink, and something to polish with. A little sandbag to work on helps. 

Kintsugi is a great little hobby, but a decent starter kit runs about $150. 

You say you don't like woodworking, but wood BURNING has about a $20 start-up cost for a burner and you can find wood for projects literally everywhere. You can combine this one with painting, gold leafing, stained glass if you have a project with glass, etc.

One-brush painting can be fun, particularly if you're into flowers and leafy shit. I learned how to do it years ago just to paint my best friend's car's rear window when she got married. 

You might look into Sumi-e."
naked_nomad,2023-01-10,"I make chainmaille: [https://www.mailleartisans.org/articles/articledisplay.php?key=19](https://www.mailleartisans.org/articles/articledisplay.php?key=19)  I use a 3/8 variable speed electric drill to turn the mandrel though. 

I mostly use 17 gauge anodized aluminum electric fence wire and wind it on 3/16, 1/4 or 5/16 inch mandrels.  I also have a 3/8 mandrel I sometimes use.

You can do quite a few things with it: [https://www.mailleartisans.org/gallery/](https://www.mailleartisans.org/gallery/)  I made a vest for a young lady using around 60,000 3/16 rings.  Friend of the family so I just did it for the challenge.  Used an XL leather vest for the pattern."
Sad-Cat8694,2021-01-23,"I like creating curios with dead things.

I'm not exactly into taxidermy, and wet specimens aren't my favorite. But I really enjoy skulls and bones. I was a kid who really enjoyed museums and liked to learn, and thankfully I haven't grown out of it. I have a few small specimens that were roadkill or forest finds. I live in a forest and have all kinds of plants and animals around, so finding remains is not unusual. Any skulls I acquire were sourced directly and responsibly.

I know it might sound a bit macabre, and it's not for everyone. But it makes me happy. I enjoy pressing flowers as well, and find that many pieces work nicely with a combination of the two.

I also enjoy yoga, dance, stained glass, jewelry-making, aerial arts, counted cross-stitch, mixed-media art, hiking, and reading. I'm not a great cook, but I love food so I enjoy putting a meal together."

There a clubs for every type of gardening - specific plants like daylilies, roses, bonsai, etc. 

Photography clubs - they exchange information, take group field trips to interesting places to take pics, hold in-club competitions, etc.

We belong to a rock & mineral club - we do jewelry making (silver smithing, copper enameling, bead design, etc.), chain mail making, faceting, stone cutting, stained glass work, fossil collecting, field trips, etc. 

We also belong to a reptile and amphibian club - folks who promote captive breeding, rescue work, species lectures, adoption of abandoned animals, fostering damaged ones & releasing them back into their habitat, etc.

It's super cheap to get into. Some brushes and paint and a piece of glass to practice on. Terribly dificult to get perfect but entertaining to try."
SandboxUniverse,2015-09-08,"My first thought is you can go broad or you can go deep.  Broad means you try a bunch of things.  It's great because you can learn techniques and concepts you can apply across your other hobbies.  Deep means you pursue things to gain expertise in particular things.   You can paint,  but can you paint a variety of styles? Use multiple mediums?  Have you studied how your choice of brush, paint, and stroke affects the outcome?  This is also great,  because eventually if you dive deep enough,  you might create a new technique entirely that you won't find otherwise.  

I'm saying all of this because you have a lot of hobbies going already.   I could suggest needlework, ceramics,  and lampwork and call it a day,  but in six months,  you might be looking for more again,   and they kind of add up over time, cost-wise.  So I'm encouraging you to also consider your approach.  If you enjoy collecting hobbies,  well,  that's a hobby too, and a fun one.  It's certainly been one of mine, although not all my outlets are creative.  

 I have taken up astronomy, cross stitch, violin, swim, gardening, raising succulents,  cake decorating,  making terrariums, fostering animals, sailing, model building...  you get the idea.  But I'm getting a lot of joy to out of astrophotography cross-stitch designs - incredibly detailed large canvases that challenge my ability to complete something big and difficult. I've also dug deep  - often literally - into gardening,  learning about the plants in my particular yard and how to deal with them.  In short,  I'm finding there is also satisfaction in diving deeper into some of my hobbies to learn that there's always more to learn inside of them."

_higglety,2018-12-17,"If you get into fiber arts, you can go down some DEEP rabbit holes. Most people are familiar with sewing, embroidery, knitting, and crochet, at least in concept, but you can branch pretty far out into some extremely niche, lesser-known specialized art forms. If you crochet, you can make garments and blankets, but you can also make soft sculpture, micro-crochet, and lace. Embroidery can be cross-stitch, chinese double-sided, Elizabethian blackwork, spanish goldwork, etc. Sewing can be quilting, cosplay, historical costuming, etc. You can weave on a vast array of looms, from the simplest back-strap loom to vertical wall looms to full-sized floor looms, and many other sizes and configurations besides. There's inkle weaving, card weaving, and finger-weaving (which is similar in structure but distinct in application from sprang). There's lots of different styles of braiding, such as finger-loop braids and kumihimo. There's knotwork such as macrame and nalbinding, and so many different kinds of lacework that i couldn't possibly list them all. If you want to get REALLY weird and niche, you could take up victorian hairwork. And every culture throughout history and around the world has their own traditions and artforms that you can explore, from the various textile manipulation techniques of japanese kimono, to the incredibly intricate and detailed mola made by the Guna. And of course beyond all that, you could explore processing and spinning fiber into the thread, string, yarn and cordage needed to do all of these!  

(not to mention, many of these crafts can branch off into other things- processing cordage can lead to basket weaving, spinning and sewing can lead to various forms of dyeing, which can lead to foraging, gardening, and chemistry, some fibercrafts require tools which aren't readily available in modern times so you may take up woodworking, smithing, carving, ceramics, or scrimshaw, etc etc ad infinitum)"

Instead of dice you use a normal deck of playing cards, shuffle them and draw them for each Exploration and Combat phase. You‚Äôll get 5 prompts to write about, you can either fight an enemy or run.

Start compost.  Throw old food and yard scraps in a pile.  Mix in dirt and it's not beautiful compost but you got some usable dirt at the end of summer.  Put some inside an old plastic tub, shred scraps and go dig up a bunch of worms.  Put worms in inside scrap pile (yes they aren't red wrigglers but some will take).  Now you have a worm farm.  

Next spring take some of your good dirt and maybe vermicompost and put in tomato seeds.  Cucumber seeds.  Pumpkin seeds.  Carrot tops.  Celery butts.  Whatever you eat.  Or go to a seed swap (check library) and get some for free.  Watch grow.  Enjoy.  Eat.

BlakeMW,2016-04-24,"And here's something cool: meditation retreats can be expensive, but Buddhist monasteries often allow the same thing for free. 

Many monasteries will have a weekly or so ""dhamma talk"" at the monastery or sometimes an associated location, usually with a guided meditation. 

Also at many monasteries it's possible to stay for free as long as you're willing to follow the schedule and are well behaved (these monasteries get an excessive amount of donations from asian Buddhists wanting to ""make merit"", it's genuinely fine to stay without donating anything if you're sincere).

This is not true of all traditions: Mahayana and Tibetan tend to charge money. Theravada tends not to. But in the west as an English speaker, best to look up ""Thai Forest Tradition"", it is popular with westerners and has monasteries in most countries, and as forest monasteries they are usually at beautiful peaceful locations.

Source: spent about 8 years of my life living in Buddhist monasteries in New Zealand, Australia and Thailand. For about 5 years as an ordained monk. It was great. And the only money I ever needed to spend was travel.

And the guests at these monasteries were all sorts, along with the expected serious meditators and devoted buddhists, we'd also get backpackers and people who just wandered in and knew literally nothing about Buddhism."

[eliminado],,"It's cheap to get into, you just need a ball of yarn, a crochet hook and access to YouTube (I learned through video tutorials).

If you get into it though, that's when the trouble starts. You might start eyeing more crochet hooks, stitch markers, tapestry scissors (at least these are one-time purchases usually). Then there's the yarn. Buying more yarn can be addictive. I accrued a lot of yarn in the early days as I just got so excited about it, but thankfully I did reach a point where I was like: ""Yeah, I definitely do not need more yarn. I'm good now.""

Crochet, being the gateway drug, also led me to knitting. Which is great, since now I have two ways to use up my sizeable yarn stash. But I also spent a small fortune on knitting needles. Straight needles, circular needles, double pointed needles in different materials, sizes and lengths.

Luckily it's not something you *have* to spend a lot of money on. But if you get low-key obsessed with your new fibre art hobbies... there may be some shopping sprees in your future."
Titanium4Life,2024-07-02,"Local thrift shops can have good to questionable quality yarn at very cheap prices. Along with crochet hooks and knitting needles.

A browse of Craigslist can be inspiring with starter kits for hobbies going cheap as folks declutter after deciding whatever hobby wasn‚Äôt a right fit. Use price filters to keep the starter kits under your budget. Facebook ‚Äúbuy nothing‚Äù groups can be even better.

Hats and socks can go years. Sunscreen and body glide go a long a way for the price, too. It‚Äôs really nothing on the hobbies scale; like sure, reading and music + a library are essentially free but in the realm of things that require gear it‚Äôs dirt cheap compared to other outdoor/exercise stuff like camping, biking, skiing (!), etc. Pickup sports are cheaper but require other people and access to courts.

ncos,2011-05-23,"I'm not even remotely an expert, but this routine works wonders for me. 

1. Try to focus on nothing but your breathing. In. Out. In. Out. No thoughts whatsoever, except that you're alive and you're breathing.

2. Recognize when your mind drifts to something else. Acknowledge it. Process it. Go back to breathing. In. Out. In. Out. 

3. Once you're solidly only thinking about breathing, try to toss that thought away too. THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT. If you successfully aren't thinking about your breaths anymore, you should have a blank mind. This is the main goal. 

4. While working towards the goal of thinking about literally nothing, continue to acknowledge any thoughts that arrive. See them. Toss them away. 

5. Meditation is meaningful and impactful for me because it allows me to process what's going on in my mind both consciously and subconsciously, recognize it for what it really is, and realize I can discard it if it's negative and unnecessary."
createch,2011-02-22,"The nice thing about meditation, aside that it has a ton of other benefits, is that as you get better at it the benefits you're mentioning start following you outside of the time you're practicing. It's technically the opposite of ""tuning out"", what it's really doing is training a ""muscle"" that gives you the ability to place your attention/focus even when there's chaos surrounding you. 

The most basic exercise is focusing on the breath, sounds easy but you'll find that your mind will instantly wander, don't get frustrated, thoughts will continuously try to pull you away from that focus, once you've been doing it for a while you will be asking yourself how you ever lived with all that chaos constantly going on in your head. If it weren't a common human experience to be constantly distracted and bombarded by the next thought that pops up in our heads we would have definitely have categorized it as some sort of psychosis."

That said, you'd do well to look for places with water.  If there's water now, there was likely water in the past.  These are the places were people have hung out for millennia.  Creek beds are good, shorelines, that kinda thing.  Farmed fields are also prime, especially after rainstorms.  Areas disturbed by building work, roads and whatnot.  

Keep your eyes peeled and look for things that look like they've been chipped.  If you think you've found something, compare your pictures with stuff online, there's tons of pictures at r/arrowheads that'll help you learn to tell an artifact from a JAR ('just a rock')

LoL_is_pepega_BIA,2019-11-13,"Adding to this, a lot of people struggle with meditation by putting in a lot of effort and stress to make their mind blank.. this is akin to a sisyphean effort. 

The whole point here is to let go of trying, let go of the effort.. you don't need to try to breathe, it just happens.. you don't need to push your mind to relax, it will happen on its own, eventually as you begin to develop better awareness of your inner thought flow and patterns, and make peace with it..

Think of your thoughts as a continuously flowing river. You can't really stop it or redirect it or even control it, so simply let it flow, let it pass.. 

One tool that's helped me is to think of the mind as a child that's trying to leave the play pen. Be kind to it and help it back inside when it leaves..

Another perspective that's really helped me is as follows.. there are 3 core tenets to meditation. For the duration of meditation, 1. you do absolutely nothing, 2. You want absolutely nothing, and 3. Most importantly, you ARE nothing (any insecurity in terms of looks or wealth, or perhaps superiority complex are things you need to let go of and ground yourself)

Also, social media and mobile apps with dark engagement patterns are  extremely anti-meditation. Please be responsible with them like any other toxic substance. Zero is best.

Edit.. some clarity and additional points"
sizam_webb,2024-03-03,"First time I was able to achieve an empty mind for a few seconds was with the help of a really great psychologist that explained it very similar to this, with the help of low dosage of a benzodiazepine. Now when I have a panic attack start to form or over stimulation focusing my mind on breathing in, and breathing out helps a lot. 

Another one that helps me sometimes is to picture the view from a couple hundred feet above, the streets and cars and business. I‚Äôm not alone, there‚Äôs a lot of people and animals and art and so much to be happy about. Takes away my problems a bit thinking about how many people are dealing with similar or even worse problems, and gives me joy thinking about everyone that just got great news, a marriage proposal, a negative test call from a doctor, a flower about to bloom. Life is great and anxiety depression are pretty poorly understood by those without either."

The hardware is expensive, especially if you want the highest settings and decent performance.

I like to get 10 cents an hour out of my software purchases, but I realize that's only possible with averages. I average shorter enjoyed experiences like e.g. Firewatch with a Bethesda Games Studios product that I spend so many thousands of hours in that the fact that the former laughs at my ten cents an hour entertainment budget not really matter.

Plus, as much as I ""enjoy"" mindlessly plugging at a BGS product on the off chance I'll see something new and interesting I'd be lying if I didn't admit that experiences like Tacoma and Firewatch are why I play games, even if Bethesda Games Studios somehow makes desecrating the dead for fun and profit feel nearly heroic.

Since I'm in the PNW I have five 10x10 tents that we put up in the front yard with lights strung.  We server adult beverages to the parents and candy and toys to the trick or treaters.  We have three of the tents party tents for the neighbors/friends with food and beverages.

I'm starting to get into cannabis cultivations which unfortunately needs to be harvested around Halloween.  I'm also into Fall mushroom hunting.  It's too much to do at the same time so I think I will stop doing the haunted garage and sell off some of the animatronics to create more room in the basement."

Extraterrestrialchip,2017-11-12,"Making patchwork quilts. Although I have found a cheaper supplier for the fabric etc, it's still not cheap for good quality cotton fabric. They usually require many different fabrics. Some are bought by length but some are precut into strips or squares which is way more convenient but kicks the cost up. 

Once the top's made you need wadding for the middle which again is costly, and then you need backing fabric which either has to be wider than standard fabric or you have to buy yards of it to piece together to cover the back.

Then the actual quilting to sew it all together; extremely difficult for a full size quilt on a standard sewing machine. You can struggle yourself (which I have) or you can have it done on a quilting machine but that's wildly expensive. Out of interest I've had quotes, they charge by the square inch and it adds ¬£100 upwards often more for a bigger quilt.

Nobody would pay for what a full size hand made quilt would cost to make."

rgstephe,2020-01-12,"I'm getting ready for my fifth year of putting on a large Halloween and Christmas light show. Honestly, I've spent so much money on this hobby, I'm a little embarrassed to even say how much.

This hobby has been fun, frustrating, downright rage inducing, and incredibly rewarding all at once.

Living in the middle of nowhere, on a dirt road, it probably sounds crazy to put on a light show for just myself and two neighbors, and that's how I felt the first season, but I found out it wasn't just for me and 2 neighbors. 

We're now quite known in the area! It has brought our small farming community together, and we get so many visitors during the holidays. It makes me proud to show off all my hardwork. 

Seeing kids' eyes just light up with excitement when they see the show with the music and display? Thats why I continue to work months and spend so much. I am getting tired though, so I'm definitely going to need some help starting this season."

punkwalrus,2010-03-05,"I have only done this a few times, and sporadically, but it was worth it. 

One example was my wife had passed away, and her former assistant became my assistant for a while. She's a great assistant, but can't get her own life together because of health reasons. At the time, her family was a piece of shit, and had a tendency to just use her as that ""unmarried aunt"" role where they'd go on these elaborate vacations and assumed she's take care of their house while they were gone. Her older brother was the worst of them. he had bought some huge McMansion somewhere for his wife and four kids. One day, he said he was going to Disneyworld and taking the whole family. That did not include his sister, but other relatives, like some cousins and their mother.

My assistant was heartbroken. Like, it crushed her. While she's not one of those over-the-top Disney fans you see on Instagram, she did like Disney a whole lot since she was a little girl.  I was an event runner, and an opportunity came up to meet with another event runner I knew who lived in Orlando and wanted to hang out for a bit. I could have easily gone by myself, but I figured if I paid for it, I could bring her. Only one caveat: she had to plan it. Airfare, hotel, the parks, everything. My event would NOT foot that bill, but I could afford to. And buddy, she did a great job.  She got us cheap tickets, cheap rooms in Disney Springs, and discounted pretty much everything. We didn't have to pay for Disney World itself, since the party we were meeting had out passes for that. But we did have to pay for Universal. 

We had a great time. While we did separate things, we spent most of the time together and I got to see Disney World through a fan's eyes. Normally, I would have just wandered aimlessly, but she had a PLAN and without her, it would have just been another trip for me. And this gave her the opportunity to finally see Disney World, something she could have never done on her own or have anyone do for her.

I am still glad I could do that for someone, and if I had more money, I'd be doing that a lot more."

Various species of wood are expensive for natural beauty.

The tools for cutting and dimensioning are expensive even second hand, but the Rabbit Hole also includes Dust Collection, Clamps, back up blades, Bright Lights, bunch of Bandaids and super glue, and possibly a shed.  (Oh, and there will be an ER visit).  Woodworking also comes with the added psychological benefit of hoarding things for years in hopes of incorporating it into a project, and viewing everyday items in new ways; Chopsticks from takeout can be used as dowel rods and coffee stirrers make great shims, glue applicators and oil mixers.

It‚Äôs creative and you do get something to show for it, BUT, it is hard, dirty work that takes 6 times as long as you think - endless mistakes and profanity that keep changing the original design.  Followed by obsessive amount of sanding only to arrive at ‚ÄúFinishing‚Äù, which really pisses me off when it points out any imperfection which sends you back to sanding.

Once the piece is finished and placed in a room, after we have toiled intimately with this project for weeks or months, we will feel the sting of the remaining mistakes each time we walk in the room.

FragDoc,2020-04-18,"Incredibly expensive hobby. I think that, outside of high-end automotive, it‚Äôs got to be one of the worst. While it can be done cheaply, you really have to love the process to do it without forking over serious cash. Absent formal training by a master, most of the modern YouTubers are using the very best equipment available which makes replicating work difficult or at least frustrating. It‚Äôs also highly commercial. I think people outside the space imagine Ron Swanson and grizzled old-timers hunched over an old workbench with a chisel when it‚Äôs really $800+ track saws, jointer/planers that can easily approach $10k, and workbench accessories that can be hundreds of dollars a piece. The audience is mostly mid-thirties to forties males approaching their maximal earning years, so the sky is the limit and the marketing audience is still small enough where influencers aren‚Äôt making massive cash piles on views and advertising, so it‚Äôs easy to put free stuff in their hands and drive purchasing.

Also, check out Arena‚Ä¶it‚Äôs technically FTP, and people are successful doing so, but I spend ~$100 on drafting each set and can usually build whatever Standard decks I want from the cards I pick up and the packs/wildcards I win drafting.

But me spending $1,000 on Warhammer over four years is seen as crazy. *""It's just plastic men!""*, yeah and my brother's bike is just aluminum and carbon fiber tubes.

Price per hour of enjoyment is amazing for me, but I love building, I love painting and I like playing.

He plays every Saturday afternoon with the same people he did back then and I think they use the official rules that require that company's paint, as well.

I have 1 army of Snotlings, played it once with him, and never played it again (I got destroyed). Kind of like Magic: the Gathering, I made it to maybe 6 starter packs and a dozen boosters and quit, three of the guys I played with had milk crates full of cards a couple of years later."

Even repairing isn't always useful. Some clothes have so poor quality fabric that it will just rip somewhere else a few days later. Insane. I have had pants that were like that. Less than 10 washes and the fabric just ripped. I mended it. Rippppp 2cm further up the next tear when wearing them after mending. Crazy. I was pissed. It is already bloody difficult to find 100% cotton clothing anymore. Sorry that is a complete different rant."
