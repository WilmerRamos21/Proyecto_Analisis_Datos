The bride’s dress was a bejeweled ballgown, hair and makeup were done at the hotel spa, professional photographer booked for the day, the works. The reception and dinner were at a fancy Italian restaurant and we traveled there in a limo. They got annulled three months later. \n",

They just celebrated their 15th anniversary.\n",

      "My cousin married twice. Her first one was a big Italian affair (our fathers are from Italy). Huge rented trolley, huge beautiful church service, amazing expensive authentic Italian catering, a gorgeous venue. That marriage lasted less than 3 years. The second guy was on a beach in Jersey, much more relaxed, sandals were provided for guests. Still a beautiful venue and amazing food but this one was about the couple and their loved ones. The first one was for show. They are still happy together 15 years later with 3 kids.\n",

      "First wedding was not that extravagant (for a wealthy HCOL city) and guests and family didn't mingle with each other. A more rough and aggressive crowd. Cheap but still very image and appearance based. Marriage lasted a couple years, but they had been together for a decade prior.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second wedding cost about half a million (free venue for reception) and way more upscale, multi day extravaganza with some (supposedly) famous people. Wedding made it into the New York Times. Sister married into a wealthy family and they got engaged after maybe a year or so? I've taken guesses at how long this one will last but who's to say.\n",

They left disposable cameras on the tables for people to capture \"special moments\" that they'd later develop and put into a wedding scrapbook.

      "The first was super fancy and expensive. Long church service, black tie affair, every wedding reception trope like garter toss and bouquet toss, long speeches, special dances, tiny portions of super fancy food, etc. The second was a quick service outside with a river front view, guys in chinos and girls in sundresses or other casual type attire, buffet and make your own sundae bar, and overall just a big party all night.\n",

      "First wedding: (high school sweethearts) generally not too extravagant, intimate ceremony on the beach out of town so only our parents and my brother/his family attended. My brother officiated and my mom made my wedding dress which was fairly simple but “beach elegant” haha. Had the obligatory reception a couple weeks after the wedding for our family/friends at a local venue. Overall it wasn’t very costly as big weddings never appealed to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second wedding: (also my husbands second wedding) We did the ceremony at my parents house, my ex-husband officiated, there were about 15 people there total- closest friends and family. My mom made party food for us to snack on and we all just hung out there for the evening and that was it. The biggest cost was our clothes- husband bought a new suit and I bought a dark green elegant style dress, maybe $500 overall. \n",

It was fun to do the traditional wedding things with the first one (bridal shower, ceremony, reception) and my last wedding just felt right for us at that time in our lives.

She had been friends with the groom for 4 years prior to their dating relationship and speedy engagement (3-6 months), but I did not sense any chemistry or compatibility. I was 19, so I figured I just didn’t know better. He was not a good guy—ended in divorce and a restraining order against him.\n",

Second she eloped with new boyfriend in Vegas (no one attended that one though; this one lasted 2? years I think). Third was another Vegas wedding, but with family present. It was nice, not quite informal but certainly not the traditional Big To Do. She’s still married to that one 15 years later.\n",

People got drunk in the fields, not in a bad way, and it was a lot of fun. It was remembered in the friend group for many years as one of the most memorable weddings. \n",
      "\n",
      "I attended my ex husband's second wedding last month. The venue was definitely fancier than in the first wedding, and the pre-meal snacks were amazing: two hours of cheese bar, charcuteríe bar, fresh seafood cooked to order... Some people were surprised that all this was the pre-wedding food! The sit down menu was also more elaborate than in his first wedding, although less abundant, which absolutely was not a problem because we were all full from the cocktail hour(s). The ambience was less debauched because we all got old I guess? A crowd of 20somethings is calmer than a crowd of 40something. This wedding was attended by a local celebrity, which attracted a lot of attention, and my own husband also caused quite an impression because he looks a bit out of the ordinary. \n",

      "It was his 2nd wedding/marriage. He was a 60something year old Vietnam vet. It was at their local church. The couple had adopted a little girl from Vietnam years before that, she was 10 at the wedding. The bride who was in her 50s-60s wore a halter dress with daisies in her hair - the dress had a very young, hippie vibe and she looked beautiful in it. Their daughter walked down the aisle with mom/bride - she had on a white ballgown dress. The groom cried when they walked towards him. \n",
      "\n",
      "The reception was at a private elementary/middle school, in the dining hall (so like a nice cafeteria). He was the IT guy there and the school offered the space as a gift. They had a local, beloved pizza/family-pub-casual restaurant cater (it was delicious). The principal/Headmaster of the school was there and he gave my then-boyfriend and I a tour. They had a fashion design/sewing room and the kids had made unconventional materials clothes displayed on the fashion forms. In the corner was a preliminary prototype of a a forearm and hand, hooked up to some computers. We learned that the 5th graders partnered with MIT students and Boston Children’s Hospital to bring the kids designs to life as real prosthetics for other kids. Isn’t that so cool?! I wish I could afford to send my kids there, ha. The principal spoke so highly of the groom. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the first dance the bride and groom just swayed and gazed lovingly, peacefully, happily into eachother’s eyes. Their daughter joined them halfway through. And they all hugged and swayed together. I cried haha. The groom’s grown children from his first marriage eventually got out of their seats and joined them, with their spouses and kids (so the groom’s grandkids). \n",

      "I just remember that in the father’s speech at the 2nd wedding, he said something along the lines of “congratulations on being picked first…. In the 2nd round.”\n",
      "My cousin first got married at age 20. It was a rushed affair because she was pregnant. It was a small family church wedding, that was entirely on the cheap. An afternoon wedding and a simple reception, with everything done by eight. No one mentioned the pregnancy in the few speeches.\n",
      "\n",
      "My cousin got divorced at age 43, when her youngest kid was grown. She had three kids with her first husband. She got re-married at 49, and it was her dream wedding. The dress, cake, flowers, reception were amazing.  It wasn't the most expensive event, but my cousin was so happy. She looked better and happier at 49, than at  the age of 20.\n",

      "Their second wedding was at the courthouse, with my brother and I in attendance. They are still married, and don’t really acknowledge that they were ever divorced. My brother (6 years younger than me and too young to remember when they got remarried) literally didn’t even know they were ever divorced until he was an adult and I mentioned it offhand.\n",
      "Both weddings were a tiny intimate affair\n",
      "2nd for groom, each bride first wedding. The second was a bit less..let's say 'jubilant'. My guess the reason was, that the groom was a widower and there was all around somber memories about the first time, even though the guests tried to not let it show.\n",
      "My aunt:\n",
      "Marriage 1 happened before I was born. I know they were both young-ish, but they were together for quite a while and had two kids. Then she seemed to get bored of him and left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marriage 2 was to a really great guy. He loved the hell out her, loved her boys, doted on her. The whole family loved him. They had a pretty big wedding and I was a bridesmaid which I thought was so cool (I was like 12). My aunt got bored less than a year after the wedding and decided to leave him. And because the state allowed her to, she took a bunch of his money too. The guy was devastated, he loved her so much, and he fought so hard to keep her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which leads to the best part. Marriage 3. To the BEST MAN from marriage 2. Both were married (to other people) when they got together. His wife was actually pregnant with Baby 2. And again, he was the BEST MAN at her wedding. The guys referred to each other as Brothers, had grown up together, super close. Well, eventually he left his wife, aunts divorce was finalised, and they got married on a beach in Florida in a very low key ceremony. Because he lived in Florida, and she had moved down there, ditching her kids completely, to be with him and play loving step mom to his kids. But they’ve been together over 10 years now! The guy sucks. Super controlling, very jealous. My mom and I hate him.\n",
      "I’ve been to both of my parents weddings. I was the flower girl when they got married to each other. For my mom’s second wedding, she did it on my grandparents farm. My boyfriend at the time ran the boombox for the wedding music and my little cousin told him he couldn’t be in the wedding because he had two rows of teeth. (He did have pretty crooked teeth.) Mom and my stepdad have been married over 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my dad remarried, he didn’t even tell us he was dating anyone. I was in college and had never met her. They planned a big picnic kind of couched like a family gathering and were planning to do a surprise wedding there. That would’ve irritated the shit out of me but my dad has always been pretty clueless about other people’s feelings. Idk, I guess it helps if you actually talk to your kids and ask them how they’re doing and share details of your life with them or whatever. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, my grandpa ended up getting really sick and was admitted to the hospital with leukemia. The picnic was canceled, they decided to tell us that they were engaged and getting married. Ok cool, no prob. They asked me, my brother and my step-sister to be in the wedding. I had pink hair at the time and my dad asked me to dye it to a natural color. My brother had just dyed his hair black so I did too. I’m naturally reddish brunette. My dad wanted to be annoyed and tell me about it but when he saw it for the first time, we were at my grandma’s house and she couldn’t stop telling me how good it looked and how much she loved it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They wanted my grandpa to be able to attend the wedding so they got married in jeans and nice shirts in the chapel of the hospital he was at. Me and my brother stood up with them with our shoe polish black hair.\n",
      "Had a cousin who is on her fourth marriage. This last one nobody brought any wedding gifts, nobody planned a big reception or anything. Just a quick sit down in the church to listen to vows than everyone dipped. If she has a 5th I doubt anyone will even show up.\n",
      "My uncles first wedding and second wedding both felt like big fancy parties. The bride was a lot more age appropriate the second time and her family was more relaxed somehow. He met her at a church as opposed to who knows where. The vows were less dramatic(?) but the whole thing felt more grounded in a way, even though my brothers and I got very trashed and everyone was dancing. \n",
      "\n",
      "His third wedding is bound to be a weird one since his girlfriend speaks not one bit of English. If he gets married again that is.\n",
      "I know this girl who got married at 18. Shotgun weddings she was pregnant with their second child. The police should have been involved sooner cuz he was over 21 and she was 15 when she got pregnant. I know cuz he would buy her cigarette and beer if she asked. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second wedding was after she divorced the first guy. Shotgun again. \n",
      "\n",
      "I heard about the third wedding that ended because she cheated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth one was also a shotgun, but this time she finally got her girl so she got her tubes tied after. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last I heard she’s with a completely different guy and says she won’t marry again.\n",
      "First wedding, the groom and his family were all about appearances. Groom’s mother was a nightmare through the whole process. One of those “boy mom”s who would hate anyone that her son is involved with. She interfered in wedding planning in all the stereotypical ways. Groom never really made close friends, so most of his guests were from his military unit. The bride was not exactly unhappy on the wedding day, but her heart wasn’t fully in it. It wasn’t the wedding she wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marriage went much the same as the wedding. He wanted to keep up appearances so badly with his peers, but not in a natural way where they could be themselves. His family continued to be rude bordering on monstrous. The marriage lasted 2-3 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her second wedding was an entirely different affair. Bride and groom bought a house together before getting married. They spent a year putting their hearts into the house and yard. Were married in their back garden by a friend. Bride was radiant. Groom was radiant. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s been maybe 10 years now. They have a gaggle of children. They still love each other.\n",
      "The first time he married a woman, the second time he married a man. \n",
      "\n",
      "Seems much happier this time around 💙🧡❤️\n",
      "Speaking about myself, I married a dude when I was 24. We didn't spend a TON but we spent enough that it made me sick at that age. I hated wearing dresses, I didn't like the decor. It just felt so fake. I think we got married because that was just what we were \"supposed\" to do at that age. We had only been together for 2 years. Separated over sexual differences ~7 years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Got married again last year at 39 after being with the new guy for 6 years. We were in Las Vegas for something else and decided to do it. Just the 2 of us, in a drive thru chapel. Cost like, $300 total. I wore a cute romper, he was in jeans and a tuxedo T-shirt. I like him a lot more than I ever liked the other guy. We're incredibly sexually compatible. I think I'll probably hang out with him until I'm old.\n",
      "My dad has been married five times: \n",
      "\n",
      "1) My mom: Based on what I’ve heard, big church wedding, all the family and friends. Expensive. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Backyard wedding: Just the kids and a random officiant. We were told the day of the wedding. \n",
      "Divorced due to him cheating on her with a different woman, same name as her. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Courthouse wedding: She claimed to be an heiress and have cancer, they met online and my dad wanted to lock her down ASAP.  She tried to kill him at least twice. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Local bar: Some friends, some family. Married in their motorcycle gear (including chaps). I mainly came for the good pizza and to see my cousins. \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Courthouse: Remarried Wife #4 after the divorce. No one but an unknown witness.  Surprisingly, they’ve been together for some time and I’m actually kind of rooting for them now. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The kicker? Wives 1-4 go in alphabetical order. A, B, C, and D. Between 4 and 5 we took bets on who E would be, but then he remarried #4 so it’s A, B, C, and double D. No clue if he recognizes it.\n",
      "My sibling.\n",
      "\n",
      "First wedding - pretty fancy by my standards lol. Big joint bachelorette weekend away with their fiancée (my sibling still identified as a female lesbian when they got married first time around), hired out a big hotel we all stayed in the night before and night of the wedding. Bridesmaids, groomsmen and flower girls all over the place. Huge cake, speeches, sit down dinner, reception went on til the wee hours etc etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their wife cheated on them multiple times, finally with an apparently not-very straight women she met at an IVF clinic leading to divorce. After that, my sibling did a lot of soul searching and came out as non-binary. They met someone new online during covid lockdowns who had also been married once before. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second wedding - They eloped! Went for what we all thought was just a weekend trip to a spa together. Came back, everything seemed totally normal. A few weeks later they were holding a fundraising gala for a local charity. During the event, the charity founder (a close friend of my sister-in-law) came out to give a speech and ended it asking us to watch a video. The video was...my siblings second wedding! My sibling and their new wife had disappeared during the presentation, and suddenly walked out in a wedding dress and kilt respectively, and had their first dance right there and then. The gala turned into a wedding reception and raised a ton of money for the charity lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really love how they did it. Neither of them wanted to have the hoopla of a big wedding again. They didn't want their families to feel under pressure to spend a lot on clothes and gifts and extraneous stuff so just sprung it on us and only asked that if we wanted to do anything, support a charity they both love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit - I just realised there were no groomsmen first time, they'd have been bridesdudes, I guess?\n",
      "By the 3rd wedding my sister got married on April fools day at the courthouse and we rented out our favorite old school pizza joint with 20 family members. 1st wedding was much more of an event with 100 people. 2nd wedding war bigger but the grooms parents wanted to keep a certain image and paid for it.\n",
      "I went to wedding 3.0 last year. The become more low-key as the versions grow.\n",
      "My older brother got married, divorced, then remarried in about a 5 year span. The first wedding was big and in a Catholic Church. He and the bride were not Catholic, but she wanted a very traditional looking wedding in a Catholic Church, so they had to take a course to convert in order to do it. She was a nutcase who put our and her parents through so many pregnancy scares that they stopped believing it whenever she told them that she was pregnant, because they realised it was likely for attention. She did all sorts of attention seeking things, from claiming to being anorexic (she wasn't), to claiming she was diagnosed with having cancer (she didn't). When they were reading their vows, my brother cried, which made the bride happy, since in her eyes they must be tears of joy, the perfect show for a perfect wedding. I know my brother though, and those were \"Oh, fuck\" tears. Within six months they split because she was cheating. \n",

      "The first one brought tears to my eyes because they used the music from “Up” during the procession. It was out in the country and had a cozy, rustic feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second was in a major city in a ritzy venue. The first dance was to Frank Sinatra “Love and Marriage”. And I thought what an odd decision. I cannot hear that song and not think of “Married with Children”, depressed shoe salesmen, going to the nudie bar, toilet in the tv room, living just above the poverty line, rampant misogyny. I mean even as a budding feminist teenager I thought the show was pretty funny in its satire and cynicism especially in the early seasons but… hmm. It’s a choice.\n",
      "Every time they look less trusting\n",
      "My first was the traditional big wedding everyone expected. But this kind of judgement is why I didn’t invite anyone but my best friend to witness my second wedding outdoors in a pretty place. And the third was just our parents and siblings in my parent’s great room. 🫣\n",
      "I haven’t attended anyone getting married more than once. But I do have a friend who married five times. The most recent marriage is back with #3, who honestly seems like the most stable one of all her spouses. I’m not close with her, but she’s a fascinating person. I wish her all the best.\n",

The ceremony was over an hour long (full mass). The reception was at the local Knights of Columbus which wasn’t bad. Our family always throws great parties and this one was pretty memorable. I remember the bridesmaids wore very pretty buttery yellow satin dresses with matching neck scarfs, which seemed very elegant to me (it was the 90s) They drove away in the groom’s Nova (he raced cars at a Moreoso speedway) and got pulled over almost immediately for speeding (thankfully no DUI)\n",

The second one was low key, slightly larger (had some mutual friends along with family) and in a mid-grade hotel. Reception was in the hotel event/ballroom with a basic food course and cupcakes in place of cake. Both times it was just the ceremony, and then dinner. First one was about 1400 bucks (in 2004) and the second was about 2800 (in 2009.)\n",

It was adults only and the pictures are nothing but drinking and sexy/flirting dancing with all kinds of guys. She wore a black blazer and a pinstripe miniskirt with a fedora. Kind of bizarre. They were married for a few years until he pulled a gun on her. She woke us up in the middle of the night, shoved a bunch of shit in garbage bags, and we all snuck out before he could stop us.\n",

She won’t leave him because she’s worried she won’t survive without his disability money. She is also on disability because of a back injury. She was a victim of the opioid crisis and unfortunately looks like a shell of her former beautiful self. Cops are at their house regularly. I live 7 hours away and can’t do much to help.

      "\n",
      "**Wedding #1:** The groom at my first wedding was well-liked by my family and friends at the time, though most said they saw red flags early on and tried to ignore them. I think our wedding was really representative of a lot of the good and bad of our relationship though.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wedding itself was fun. We had it in this lovely firehouse-turned-venue with beautiful chandeliers and a floral courtyard. We got married outside, my dad proudly walked me down the aisle. He whispered to my mom (they've been divorced since I was 2) that they'd finally done it, I was grown up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole wedding was 1920s speakeasy themed. We had a cigar bar, outdoor s'mores pit, a huge potluck (we're from the midwest, potlucks are legitimately fun), karaoke and ended the night with a burlesque show.\n",
      "\n",
      "All-in-all, a fun wedding. But... The only reason we chose 1920s is literally because we couldn't agree on music. He didn't help with any aspect of the wedding. He also didn't even try on his wedding suit and ended up having to hem his pants with a hot glue gun before the ceremony. We brushed it off as funny but I look back at it now and realize how little he cared.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's kind of it. He didn't care. He cheated on me all through our marriage, largely leached off me financially and was never, EVER a real partner to me. But all of my friends and family loved him. We put on a great show together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our wedding was so full of family and friends. I've never felt more loved. Loved by everyone except for the guy I was marrying.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Wedding #2:** My second husband and I got together during the pandemic. We'd been friends for 10 years prior to ever considering dating. Most of our friends hadn't really seen us together much because of COVID. My second wedding... wasn't fun, really. I was planning it from 3 hours away from the venue. I wanted it to be more representative of ME and US and not be some facade we put on to wow people. While I think we did that, it just wasn't the same as my first wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attendance was much lower. My first husband was a social butterfly and my second husband is not. I did, however, have some unexpected guests travel great distances to attend and it really deepened those friendships.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made a cool Sailor Moon-themed staff to carry down the aisle. My husband dressed kind of like a wizard. No one walked me down this time. We also decided to officiate our own wedding. We had an officiant there to sign the paperwork, but he didn't join us in front of the crowd. Instead, we hosted and officiated ourselves. It gave us a chance to show our friends and family who we were together and share more of our story that I think a lot of them missed out on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 8 years between my first and second weddings, a lot of my family has grown older. They didn't stay for the reception beyond dinner. This time, our reception had catering from a dear friend and we set up areas to play Rock Band and dance. Those who did stay, we had a great time with, but the crowd was small.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, given my lack of planning, a lot of things the day of didn't go smoothly. We were on a small budget. I was exhausted and frustrated. Our ceremony was lovely and we had fun with the folks that hung out. It was just... different. I was disappointed, I think, because I didn't feel as loved by my friends and family as I did at my first wedding. But I figure... you can't really replicate that.\n",
      "\n",
      "What sucks is I am so, so happily married. My husband is a perfect match for me and my mental health is so dramatically better than it was in my first marriage. My friend circle is much smaller at this point in my life but like... I had this second wedding because I wanted to have the types of memories I had with my first husband. The wedding, the honeymoon, etc. A lot of the firsts were robbed from us by COVID.\n",

      "An old friend of mine has been married three times. I attended all three weddings.\n",
      "\n",
      "First was a traditional church wedding, first for both bride and groom, a few years after college. Wedding was preceded by a bachelor party (probably bachelorette party, too) and followed by a reception. White lace for the bride, matching bridesmaid dresses, rented tuxes for the groom and his attendants. Flowers, cake, presents, food. Many family and friends - I'd say 200 guests. This marriage lasted for about 18 years and produced one child. (Bride decided she wanted someone different.) \n",
      "\n",
      "Second wedding was second for both bride and groom. Each had a child from previous marriage. It was smaller, and was held outdoors in a lovely park, with about 50 guests, all family and close friends. This union lasted for about 3 years and produced a second child. (Bride turned out to be less committed to the marriage than she had indicated. Frankly, in my opinion *she* ought to have been committed.) \n",
      "\n",
      "Third marriage was to a once-divorced woman. Very small wedding party, really only bride and groom with a single attendant each. It was held in their backyard garden. Maybe 30 guests total. Low-key, much more emotional than either of the two previous weddings. (Bride is a stellar human being.)\n",
      "\n",
      "My take? The third wedding was clearly a love match, stripped down to the powerful attraction between two people. It played down the outward elements like the church, the cake, the music, the attendants and whatnot that characterized the first two weddings. It was by far the most moving, to me, and I am confident this one will last until death parts them.\n",
      "If I were to get divorced and then remarried, I'd be too embarrassed to have another wedding and invite the same people.\n",
      "My mom got married twice in my life. First stepdad, they did a shotgun wedding in Reno or Vegas. I forget where. Second stepdad, they got married in their church with a nice, small wedding. \n",

      "My older brother has been married 3 times. First one was awful, wedding wise. Anyone who could be objective knew they were too young and shouldn’t be getting married. She cheated, took half of everything and fucked off back to the upstate of South Carolina. Second one was the love of his life he and she were both so very happy and all around it was a great wedding. Cancer took her 11 years ago. 3rd one was ok. I’ll leave it at that.\n",
      "Second one was in Vegas…. Pretty sure they were /are swingers. They are still married 15 years later.\n",
      "I was best man at my friend's first wedding. The second wedding, he invited me, but I wasn't in his wedding party. He said I was bad luck! It was a super fun wedding, and he's still married after almost 20 years. It's not all because of me. It's probably not because of me at all. I did my part though.\n",
      "The second venue was much nicer and I think so was the the second divorce. \n",

      "\n",
      "Oh and I wasn’t invited to the third wedding, and was told by her dad that it wasn’t because of the dog.\n",

      "I only went to wedding #4 for my Uncle, but during the speeches his brother gets up, looks at the best man (also there for the 4th time), and says: 'Bob we have to stop meeting like this'.\n",
      "Been to all my brother's weddings.  The key change is that each one was smaller in scale than the previous.  Most recent, and hopefully the last (fingers crossed), was in May of this year.  Fewer than 50 people and very low-key.  All the traditional vendor roles were handled by friends.\n",

This one was at my parents' house, in their front yard. My ridiculous ass mother wanted me to include a broom jumping in the ceremony, but since we're whiter than white bread, I refused. The entire wedding party, bride and groom included, wore Realtree hunter's camo... The bride's side in pink, the groom's in natural. They divorced after he cheated on her (like he did on all of his previous wives... a lesson there, I think). At least she was done making babies at this point. Lordt.\n",

The bride was lowkey in a bad mood throughout the second wedding, saying that she was mainly just trying to appease her mom and family and just wanted to get on with her marriage and new husband. They have 2 kids now.\n",
      "This is exactly like my sister's first wedding although she didn't go into debt for it, my parents paid for it and it was very expensive. Her second wedding which was about 4 years later was far smaller, more intimate, and she and her fiance paid for it completely. I guess that one worked, it's been almost 30 years since her second wedding and they're still going strong.\n",

      "I can relate - my first wedding was in front of a judge, one month before our daughter was born. My parents and some of my sisters attended. Her parents didn't. I remember that my family was not thrilled. That was in 1984. I went into the Navy and we moved to Norfolk eventually. She cheated while I was at sea and wanted out. Divorce was finalized in 86. \n",

This relationship wasn’t great, but I stuck with it longer than I should have partly because i knew my friend thought we would be good together. After I eventually broke it off, I was talking with my friend and she said that she was glad we broke up because she didn’t like the way my ex was treating me. I wish she had said something!\n",

Her marriages weren't particularly short, a minimum of five years each. Marriage number four is the keeper it seems. She is also in her 60s. She is happy, he is nice.

The only complaint was from my wife because the Peking duck came out during our first dance so she missed out on it (and Peking duck was part of why we picked that restaurant).

      "They dated for 3.5 years before getting engaged. She confessed after the proposal that she was disappointed in how it happened — he didn’t have a ring when he proposed and didn’t get one for months afterwards. She started grad school a couple months later and met a guy in her program that she said she really liked. She said she was getting cold feet about the wedding; we talked about it and I told her it was probably just wedding jitters and stress. Nothing ended up happening with that guy; she finished her program and they never spoke again. \n",

I’ve been to large/expensive weddings that rocked, just as much as some that sucked. And I’ve been to small/cheap weddings that rocked, just as much as some that sucked. What always makes the difference is how much care the couple and their family put into making the experience nice for everyone. \n",

      "I had a big wedding - and it was great! Going on fifteen years of marriage, over twenty years together overall - but to this day the best wedding I’ve ever been to was my little sister’s, which was carried out in my parents’ backyard with homemade decorations and a local bbq place for the catering. \n",

      "I've found that people who don't invest a ton into their wedding do so because they've invested more into their marriage.  When my husband and I got married, there were 10 people in total including us.  The most expensive thing about the wedding was my $180 dress.  Of course I always dreamed of having a big, over-the-top wedding, but what it really came down to was that I just wanted to be married to him.  I didn't care how that happened.\n",
      "This is true but you can still be interested in throwing a nice event and care about your spouse.\n",
      "So, yes, there is a study, but it doesn’t take into account that low-income couples (those who would spent very little on a wedding) can’t always afford a divorce, which skews the numbers a bit and makes it seem like spending less on a wedding means a more successful marriage. I’d imagine there is some truth to it though, just not as much as that study suggests.\n",

      "Of all the unhealthy memes in society around weddings, the two unhealthiest are probably the obsession with rings and this idea that jitters are normal. No, they're not, it's your subconscious telling you that you really shouldn't do this.\n",
      "This makes me think that photographers should have veto power or something.\n",
      "Ugh I feel exactly the same as you in this. I always hated seeing especially the photo of us walking back down the aisle together and I looked so freaked out and now it's burned in my mind among all the other things that should've told me the mistake I was making back then\n",

      "The problem is when you're in the midst of an emotionally abusive relationship you can't hear it when friends and family try to warn you. You become a master of the \"oh but our good times are so good\" and \"it's only when I do X that bothers him he becomes a problem so I just need to get better about not doing X\" mental gymnastics. They try to give you every exit, but you still have to be the one to walk out the door and it takes something like an AVERAGE of 13 times to leave an abuser.\n",

      "\n",
      "An abusive partner does EVERYTHING to try and drive a wedge between the victim and their support network. A family member saying ‘you need to leave’ is absolutely right, but gives the abuser an excuse to say ‘see? They want to break us up! I am the only person you can trust’. Equally it can make it harder for the victim to seek help out of fear of an ‘I told you so’.\n",

We kinda eloped - we told our families but no one was invited to our simple wedding in Gatlinburg, just our best friends who were married to each other.  Both the guys showed up drunk to the chapel.  Yeah, I was going through it even though ALL the red flags were there.\n",

Our caterer was a local chain that we loved and had gone to often, one of those places that everyone can always agree to go to because they have solid, unpretentious but good quality food.

      "Proposing without a ring isn’t a great decision unless you’ve explicitly discussed it with your partner in advance and for (generally monetary) reasons chosen to wait.

Of course the aesthetic vibe contributes to people’s experience, but it’s not *the whole* thing. They remember if they had enough to eat and drink, if the music was terrible, if the flow of the day stagnated, if they were seated with awkward strangers or people they could relate to, if logistics were smooth or not. I’ve had weddings where I don’t remember the couple’s vows but I remember how fucking uncomfortable the chairs were.\n",

      "Honestly, the only big wedding I attended and really had a blast at was a Jewish one, though I dream of attending a chill large Indian wedding. You can absolutely do \"big\" really well, but it's less about the aesthetics still and more about small fun wedding vibes but on a bigger scale cause bigger guest list and more food. The chair dance at my friend's wedding (the Jewish one) was super fun.\n",
      "Almost the same here. 11 people with the minister we hired, who managed to be cheaper than the park we rented at either $250 or $500, I can’t remember anymore. My dress was $35 and shoes were $40, both from Target. \n",

Things got better when I started reaching out first. 2) I only talked to someone for a day or two before saying something like, “let me know if you ever want to get together for a drink.” The long getting to know you conversations before a date never went anywhere- I always built an image of a person in my head that was always inaccurate OR they never actually wanted to meet in person. 3) I started being really blunt about what I was looking for.

      "I’m more fortunate than most guys. I check off the six feet and six figures boxes, but that only gets you to the first date. After that, the illusion fades. The dynamic resets to how people saw you in middle school. They sense something off, something hollow, and they back away. Not just stereotypically shallow women either, it's professionals, nerdy women, even the friends of friends who were pitched on you by friends. It’s like they’ve spotted a gorilla that wandered out of its enclosure. They don’t scream or bolt, but you can feel them determinedly moving toward the exit.\n",

      "I’m gonna throw in some advice from a guys perspective. You say you are into people who care about their health, do you do exercise that is mostly solo or can be more community based? If you join a club to get your exercise like Karate, cycling, climbing gym, drop-in volley ball, or a local tennis club you could put yourself around more people with a shared interest. The building of shared experiences outside of the pressures of dating can allow you to low key evaluate men to decide if they would be a good match. I find dating apps and dating in general brings more tension and anxiety than just being around other people in a social setting. It can also put you around a larger potential dating pool.\n",
      "IMO lack of physical attraction does not fall under the category of “things to overlook.” Someone having crooked teeth, or their favorite Tv show being ‘Friends’ is something to overlook. You should be physically attracted to your partner.\n",

And at the time I thought I wanted to be an academic so I was worried that speaking up would somehow hurt my own career, especially since there wasn't any actual policy violation to point to. That's part of what made it tricky to navigate--I felt like I had to turn him down without making him feel bad or upset, otherwise I might be hurting my career before I had even really started it.\n",
      "I honestly think lots of people think of themselves as good people with good intentions, so it doesn't occur to them that they might be making someone uncomfortable when they hit on them. This is especially true in mentor type relationships, where there's a power dynamic but the person with more power might not realize it (because the power might be more about the connections they have vs direct firing power for example). They might know they would never do anything to affect their mentee's career if they get turned down, but they forget that the mentee has no way of knowing that. It's also really crappy to have to think, \"does this person respect my skills or just want to sleep with me? Do I have skills, or was this always about sleeping with me?\" Hitting on your mentee can make them uncomfortable in lots of ways and I wish people were more thoughtful about these things. The same goes for professors hitting on students the second a class is over. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm glad your mentors ended up mostly working out, and I hope the initial experience wasn't too uncomfortable. It sucks that it happened to you, let alone twice. And you can feel however you want about it (including anger, or nothing at all). It's your experience so what you think is what matters. My mentor ended up being a jackass (had to block him on many platforms), but the whole experience has pushed me to help younger colleagues whenever I can. Hopefully someday I can be the type of mentor I wish I had had.\n",
      "This is so true. Some men are very quick to blame a woman instead of knowing her story.\n",
      "That’s super fair, sometimes it can be a slow build. After a couple months though, if it didn’t develop, it’s probably not going to.\n",
      "Exactly the reason why schools need policies against that. I'm sorry you went through that, I hope you've found joy in whatever path you've taken.\n",
      "Yeah this is why I’m still confused by it. I knew both of them were good people before that, and them hitting on me felt like it was supposed to feel more wrong than it did. But I kind of knew they wouldn’t punish me or anything like that afterwards.\n",
      "  \n",
      "People end up feeling overly comfortable with me really fast all the time so that played a part and I get it. It’s hard to find people to trust and people trust me so they think it has to be something special.\n"
