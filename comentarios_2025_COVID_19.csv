ShiningRayde,2010-01-27,"CBS News: [COVID variant NB.1.8.1 hits U.S. What to know about symptoms, new booster vaccine restrictions](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-symptoms-booster-vaccine/)

This is after China has been public about this variant spreading and taking measures to secure against it, while the gutted CDC barely issued a memo about it being detected in the US."
mads_61,2019-12-15,"My mom’s best friend passed away from COVID just a few days ago. My friend’s wife is now (permanently?) disabled from long COVID. She had to quit her job as a surgeon because now she can only be awake for a few hours a day. She can no longer walk and has trouble speaking. I’d say COVID is still worth being cautious of. 

Not unlike the flu; most people who get it will be fine but others will die, and more will be disabled (I sustained lung damage from a bad bout of H1N1 I caught in high school). It’s worth exercising caution during flu season too."
dfinkelstein,2011-09-16,"People are less eager to watch news about it now, so there's less news about it. Private news networks broadcast whatever people are watching. If talking about COVID drives their viewers to switch channels, then they don't talk about it. It doesn't matter what the reality is. 
    
When reality suits their profits, then they talk about what's really going on. When it doesn't, then they talk about something else. You cannot watch private news stations and make some sort of inference about what must be happening based on what what they are or are not talking about.
    
If the station was being attacked by terrorists, but viewers kept tuning out when they brought it up, the they'd stop bringing it up, and you'd only find out when they entered the camera frame."
punkindle,2021-01-08,"I work in healthcare. It goes up and down about twice a year. Currently it's low, likely to go up again.

We had a big wave last summer. A smaller wave around Christmas.

As a country, we should have spent some money improving the ventilation systems of public buildings and transportation. Did you know if a plane is just sitting on the tarmac they switch off the ventilation systems? I wouldn't go on an airplane without a high quality N95 mask."

Affectionate_Big8239,2022-05-01,"Like any illness with a vaccine that’s available, it has become way less of an issue because people now have some level of immunity from vaccines or infection.  People still get sick & die, but in way fewer numbers due to the vaccines."

Relevant-Package-928,2020-12-16,"I had it almost a year ago and still can't smell or taste anything right. My husband brought it home from an overseas flight so he got a huge viral load and was really, really sick. It took him several months to recover."

Pokabrows,2015-06-01,"Nah it's still a problem. People just got bored of being safe. I super recommend learding about long covid. There's a lot of long term chronic diseases people are getting due to damage from covid. 



I was so bad off from long covid last year I had to use either a cane (or a wheelchair for longer distances) for a while. Still on medication because my nervous system/ circulation is messed up but I'm able to go on proper walks again now so am able to slowly work on my stamina again. I mask everywhere because if I get sick again I could end up right back where I was and might not be as lucky in recovery next time."
Skiamakhos,2010-03-15,"The availability of vaccines tends to mean it's not such a big deal now. My mum was afraid to take the vaccine so when she had a fall & went into hospital for a dislocated metatarsal bone (lisfranc injury) & had to wait a week to be seen, she caught COVID while there. Her lungs failed. They put her on 7l/h of O2, then 14, but her lungs were a mess of blood clots and she died. This was after lockdown had finished & they weren't making a big fuss about COVID, but fully half the staff in that hospital were sick with COVID and off work. I've had all my shots & I haven't had COVID yet, but plenty of my friends have. It's like a bad 'flu, so they say, but if you're lucky that's it. 

That said... Long COVID is definitely a thing. Complications are definitely a thing. One of my friends is now on kidney dialysis 3x a week because of it. His kidneys got blood clots in them & failed. Another has had multiple strokes & finds it hard to work in his old role as a software developer. There is a significant risk of disability with this. Even with the vaccine, you've got a good chance of surviving but ending up with some debilitating disability.

They're not even counting the casualties these days though. If you can get your shots, take 'em. If you have it, stay indoors if you can, mask up if you have to go out. It hasn't gone anywhere, but the people in charge reckon profit is more important than people."
Conscious-Reserve-48,2023-06-02,An average of 350 Americans have been dying each week from COVID but it’s mostly people over 75 so no one cares.
tnderosa,2022-08-01,"Latest thing I read is another variant is starting to show in US. It is something to worry about bc even if you’ve had covid before, another infection can still cause long covid and with every infection, it actually affects your brain. We do not know yet the long term effects of covid but there are studies that suggest it does have some long term impacts"

For me, COVID caused an autoimmune response that almost killed me. 

So largely people have ""moved on"", though my heart breaks for those with long COVID or similar complications. The world has largely move on, but some of them had their life forever altered by a roll of the cosmic dice and our inability to contain it earlier and prevent the spread before vaccines existed.

magic_crouton,2018-09-30,Its still here along with a ton of other viruses it's endemic.  And it will continue to kill and disable some people. I dont understand why in rhe US we are so averse to helping not spread germs and people are out sick across the board coughing and spreading their germs all over everyone instead of just showing a minimal amount of consideration and tossing a mask on and washing their hands.
Famous_Fondant_4107,2020-10-16,"Covid is still a problem and it’s still a pandemic. It was declared “over” for political reasons, not scientific. 

It’s not mild now. It is still killing people. Millions of people worldwide have and are continuing to get Long Covid. There is no cure. 

The vaccines don’t prevent transmission and they don’t prevent Long Covid. *Up to date* covid vaccines can help prevent severe acute illness and hospitalization. 

There are over 400,000 studies showing how covid damages our bodies. It’s a vascular illness and can impact every system and organ in our bodies including the brain. 

Wearing a well fitting KN95, KF94, N95, FFP2, FFP3, CAN99, or P100 mask does a great deal to protect people from Covid because it is airborne. Airborne means it is produced simply by breathing, even by people with no symptoms, and lingers/moves in the air like smoke. Opening windows and running air purifiers helps as well but nothing can replace the efficacy of a well fitting respirator mask. 

Stay safe! 😷❤️"

saveyboy,2018-12-05,It’s still out there. It’s not going away.
Ok-Tooth-4306,2024-01-20,"I managed to avoid it until last August. I’m assuming I got it from my nephew’s wedding as he tested positive and his dad (who doesn’t believe in testing 🙄) had symptoms. I have all my vaccines and mine was pretty mild. Felt like a sinus infection, but when I spiked a fever I knew it was something else. My symptoms lasted 3 days I think and by day 7 my new test came back negative. It still is going around but certain people will make you think it’s not or that everyone reacts the same way to it. My husband had it in 2020 and he was down for almost 10 days. He’s never been sicker in his life."
BanMeForBeingNice,2024-08-12,"\> Are we immune to it now?

No we are not at all. It's still spreading, and still kills around 300 people a day. What's particularly nasty about it is that it can sicken people for a long time, and it affects more than the respiratory system."

Calm-Maintenance-878,2021-01-27,"We are not fully immune, 300ish people a week die from it in America. Like a common cold, there won’t be a full immunity ever. There are many more things that kill over 300 a week so that also helps the public perception dissipate regarding it."
Several_Bee_1625,2025-03-24,"It's still around. The vast majority of people have some level of immunity to it due to vaccination and/or previous infections. So it's not as deadly, in general, for most people.

But immunity wanes and viruses mutate. So there will probably be surges every so often, like there are with the flu, some more serious than others.

Unfortunately, Trump is cutting programs meant to monitor the virus (and other public health threats) and stay prepared for it."

Wise-Field-7353,2024-07-17,"It's still circulating, and we're waiting on a summer wave of the new variant to hit. Now that almost everyone has had some exposure, dying of it is less common but still possible. 


Every infection is a dice roll in terms of severity, and your chance of long covid increases with each infection. By your forth infection, you're more likely to have long covid symptoms than not.


The best way to protect yourself is to wear an N95 in public spaces, and get your boosters."
CaptainAwesome06,2013-12-06,"People are still vulnerable to it, such as immunocompromised people (including old people). The vaccines help keep people out of the hospital. For the people who couldn't get vaccinated (or refused to), a lot of them already died. People who claim it's just a cold have survivorship bias."
EveryAccount7729,2025-04-17,"The latest strain is NB.1.8.1 and apparently it is causing worse health outcomes than some of the previous milder strains. 

you may be encouraged to get another booster soon as this is just coming to the USA now."
darklogic85,2019-09-09,"It's a combination of things. People have partial immunity to it now, due to people contracting it, and due to vaccines. Also, the virus has mutated over time, so the variants spreading now, are less dangerous than the variants at the beginning of the pandemic. It's a natural process for a lot of viruses and bacteria to mutate in a way that boosts their own rate of survival. It typically isn't beneficial to the virus or bacteria to kill its own host, so the more successful variants of a virus are the ones where the host lives the longest, or doesn't die at all, to give the virus the best chance of spreading to another host. That partially explains the variants that are common now.

We might see case numbers rise in the US in the next couple years though, if covid boosters are no longer available to people every fall as they have been the last few years."
FenisDembo82,2022-09-08,"The federal government has decided that only people with certain risk factors or who are over the age of 65 are not to be given Covid vaccines and boosters anymore,  so expect it to become more of a problem as new variants emerge."
Hour_Insurance_7795,2020-09-08,"It's still around, it's just not huge news that drives clicks anymore, so the media has largely moved on (despite what they claim, the media is in the business of generating views more than disseminating information)..

HistoricalString2350,2023-09-27,There’s a new strain starting in China. It will now be another seasonal thing in the fall winter like the flu and RSV every year. It might get really bad again with the cuts to vaccines for people only over 65.
kayae_,2022-02-15,"It can still be dangerous to the vulnerable ones, just like the flu. It can also come with post illness problems. I get vaccinated once a year and still wear a mask on public transport - my family member is post transplant and I try not to give them anything, not to mention covid or flu.

The_Wee-Donkey,2025-05-02,"It was a big deal because our healthcare systems couldn't cope with the number of severe cases, not because of the disease itself. When it first hit, it was spreading exponentially, and a sizeable number of those cases spent weeks in the hospital preventing the treatment of patients with other illnesses and conditions. 

The idea of socially isolating was to try and slow the spread of the disease, not to stop it altogether. If we could slow down the spread, we could delay people getting sick and therefore spread out the severe cases and give the hospitals a fighting chance to help care for all in need and not just the first ones through the door. Basically, instead of having x number of cases a week, it would be x number of cases a month, giving patients access to the resources . Of course, part of it was to protect the most vulnerable in our society by keeping the disease away from them where possible. 

Now, since the vaccine, the number of severe cases has reduced drastically. This is how vaccines work. They provide your own body with the tools it needs to fight off the infection, which greatly reduces the harsher symptoms. Now for most people a case of covid is like a cold/flu and while it might knock you on your ass, it is less likely to see you end up in hospital, meaning we don't need to keep socially isolated. 

However, like the flu, it can have bad years where the strain going around can be particularly nasty, giving rise to severe cases and may overwhelm hospitals again. We've thankfully not had a year where we've had to socially isolate again because flu is on the rise but you might hear doctors request people to get the vaccine to again slow spread and reduce case numbers."

PoopMobile9000,2019-06-17,"As expected, it went from pandemic to endemic.

The pandemic was the virus’s mad rush across a population with no immunity. The moment Covid-19 arrived and spread a little, it became a certainty that basically everyone on earth would eventually gain antibodies—either through a vaccine or getting sick.

Now everyone on earth *has* gained those antibodies, through vaccine or illness or both. Like all viruses it continues to mutate and our immunity fades.  But even though the virus is still around, but it’s not making people as sick (because we all have prior immunity) and we’re not getting it all at once (because it’s spreading more slowly and less effectively).

It’s now just one of many diseases you can get, a bit worse than the common cold or flu, and still killing people who are old or immunocompromised, or just very unlucky."

FluffyProphet,2016-06-14,"A few things.

Vaccinations reduced the spread and made it so most people who get it, don’t get it as bad.

Enough people have had it that they have built up some resistance. Further reducing the spread and severity.

The virus itself mutated to be more mild but more transmissible. Still dangerous to people with underlying conditions, but much like the flu, the majority of people will be able to shrug it off after a week of life sucking. There are still greater long term risks if you contract covid (long covid), but for the majority of people, it is a less severe virus than in 2020.

Finally, it’s now factored into our normal expectations of disease rates. So culturally, we are more numb to it."

1) we have vaccines now, so if you get the vaccine you are less likely to get covid, or of you do you'll probably have more mild symptoms

2) a fast-evolving virus like this tends to become more mild over time.  The strains of covid that killed the host or even made them bedridden were less likely to get passed on to another person, whereas the strains you can still go to work with get passed around much more.  

3) the virus is much more spread out in time right now.  One of the biggest problems during the start of the pandemic was how fast it spread--so fast that new people were getting sock and needing hospital resources faster than the hospitals could keep up with.  Lots of people were dying that could have been saved if there was more room in hospitals.  You may remember ""flatten the curve"" as something people were saying at the time.  The meaning of that was to slow down the spread as much as possible, so that even if the same number of people overall got sick, they weren't all sick at the same time, and hospitals would have room to treat people as they got sick.  Now, I'm covid is pretty much everywhere, so while there might be seasons with more cases, in general it isn't hitting everybody at the same time, so people that do need hospital care are able to get it without much trouble."

adepressurisedcoat,2024-11-21,People still die from it. But it has mutated so many mild strains that it's less of a threat. You still absolutely can get fucked from it even if you're not immunocompromised.
skiveman,2019-06-17,"I always thought that the main problem with Covid was that it really wasn't the virus that took you down and instead it lowered your bodies response to other new or pre-existing conditions to kill you. From the data I've seen and read it seems that most (I say most because it doesn't cover everyone) people who died were also suffering from (oftentimes) multiple other conditions that were exacerbated the Covid infection. In other words the Covid infection increased your vulnerability to compounding infections and illnesses. 

This is why, while I won't get another Covid vaccine myself due to the side effects I experienced, I did encourage my mother to get one as she has several underlying health conditions that could end her life in the event of a bad covid infection.

In young males/boys though there was an elevated risk in the earlier vaccine that did induce myocarditis. Which was most oftenly seen by the sheer number of young (and apparently) healthy male sportsmen having heart attacks on their various fields of play to such an extent that it was pretty common for a time when watching football (that's soccer to any Americans reading). This has pretty much become very uncommon as the vaccine that caused this was withdrawn and replaced with others that didn't cause this. 

Ultimately if you have underlying health conditions that are serious (say you've had a heart attack or stroke or diabetes) then you should seriously consider getting the vaccine.

As for being immune. No. The covid virus is a lot like the common cold virus in that it likes to mutate quite a bit which therefore makes a universal vaccine or your body to develop immunity to the virus difficult. What happens is that if you get infected then you might develop some resistance to that particular strain of the virus but otherwise you will remain fairly susceptible to new strains of the virus. Same with vaccines as they only target the most prevalent strains each year (hence yearly updated boosters) while they maybe teach your body how to fight similar(ish) strains but you will be susceptible to anything not covered in the booster. It works very similar to flu vaccines."

It’s still important to practice safe habits around known immunocompromised people (frequent testing, regular hand washing, maybe even medical masks in certain situations), but it’s not as much of a critical risk to society now as it was before.

young_arkas,2022-10-31,"Viruses tend to evolve rapidly. All those variants were ways the virus evolved during the pandemic. Generally viruses evolve to be less deadly, since a dead host doesn't produce as many reproductions of the virus as an alive host.

On the other hand, our ability, natural as well as pharmaceutical, to handle COVID has become better. Most people had COVID or a COVID vaccine, that should make our immune system more effective in fighting it. And when someone is hospitalised with COVID, medical professionals have more experience and knowledge to save lives.

COVID has reached an equilibrium, on the one hand, it is still there, people get sick from it regularly (I had it last autumn), but it isn't so deadly, that people do everything to get around it, and it registers as barely another form of flu."

Busy-Pudding-5169,2021-01-29,Everyone is vulnerable to it. What are you talking
TrannosaurusRegina,2017-10-25,"For comparison, HIV (a virus which is very similar to SARS-COV-2 in many ways) also often has few or no symptoms, often for many *years* after infection.

It would be pretty absurd to say the “immunocompromised people are still vulnerable to HIV”, because HIV, like SARS-COV-2, *causes* damage, dysfunction, and immunocompromise!

The difference is that HIV is limited to the immune system can easily be tested, as well as treated, while SARS-COV-2 can fuck up *any* part of the body, cannot be easily tested for (because it’s not always in the blood), and there is no good treatment found yet.

*Every infection* fucks up something, even those with zero symptoms whatsoever, and every infection is another chance to get long-term, possibly permanent damage.

Losing sense of smell or taste (or having everything taste disgusting) is the most distinctive symptom, but people commonly lose abilities that they didn’t even know they had.

If you want to play Russian roulette, that’s up to you, though I certainly won’t be joining in!

Reminder that the mRNA vaccines only do anything for six months, after which time you’re worse off than before.

Definitely recommend Novavax if you can get it (which does *not* have this problem), though there’s no vaccine that can end this until they finally get an intranasal vaccine working in humans.

kammycakes,2016-07-04,"There’s a mix of truth and nonsense in this, but a lot of it’s either misleading or flat-out wrong. First off, HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are not “very similar” viruses. They’re both RNA viruses, sure, but that’s about where the similarity ends. HIV is a retrovirus that attacks and integrates into the immune system directly, while SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that hits multiple systems in the body but doesn’t embed itself in your DNA like HIV does.

It’s true that HIV can be asymptomatic for years, but trying to draw a 1:1 comparison with COVID isn’t accurate. They operate differently, spread differently, and impact the body differently. Saying it would be “absurd” to claim immunocompromised people are vulnerable to HIV because HIV causes immunocompromise makes zero sense. Being immunocompromised actually makes HIV worse if you get it, not irrelevant. As for testing, no, SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t “hide in the blood” or evade testing. We don’t test blood for it because it primarily infects the respiratory tract, and PCR and antigen tests work just fine when done correctly. HIV is tested via blood because it lives in blood cells. Totally different context.

The part about there being “no good treatment” for COVID is outdated. We have multiple treatments that reduce severity and prevent hospitalization, like Paxlovid and remdesivir. They’re not miracle cures, but they work and are widely available. The idea that every single SARS-CoV-2 infection causes lasting damage, even in asymptomatic cases, is overstated. Long COVID is real, and reinfections can carry risks, but not everyone who gets infected suffers permanent harm. That’s fear-mongering. It’s possible, not guaranteed.

The vaccine claim is just false. mRNA vaccines don’t “leave you worse off” after six months. Protection against infection does wane over time, but they still offer strong defense against hospitalization and death. Boosters help with that. Novavax is a solid option for people who don’t want mRNA, but it’s not magic either.

Lastly, that [pmc19.com](http://pmc19.com) site isn’t a legitimate scientific source and it looks like a pre-web 2.0 landing page for someones MLM scheme. I don't think that would be my go-to source for medical information."

It does **not** mean that there aren't problematic issue with catching COVID, just that you are less likely to die from it.

People just don’t want to acknowledge airborne disease transmission, don’t want to spend money on clean air, and *definitely* don’t want to mask in public, so they handwave it away.

InformalYesterday760,2025-03-07,"This particular piece of disinformation was spread on Joe Rogan's podcast and corrected, on the air, by a  guest

*In his 12 January 2022 episode, Rogan claimed the risk of myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) among vaccinated 12- to 17-year-olds was higher than the risk associated with catching Covid.

But his guest, the Australian broadcaster Josh Szeps, argued that, in fact, young males infected with the virus were up six times more likely to develop myocarditis as those who had received the vaccine. Szeps cited data from the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, suggesting a rate of about 450 myocarditis cases in every million Covid-19 infections among boys aged 12-17, compared with 77 cases a million after vaccination.

Separate data from 38.6 million people aged 16+ who were vaccinated in England identified an extra two to six myocarditis cases in every million people in the 28 days after receiving a first dose of the AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, and an extra 10 cases a million after a second dose of the Moderna vaccine.

This compared with an additional 40 cases a million people in the 28 days after a positive Covid test.*

(Assuming you are NOT vaccinated for measles)."

BootyMcStuffins,2022-06-13,"I didn’t say you shouldn’t get a Covid shot. I’m just pointing out that people clutching their pearls over this 300/week number aren’t using their critical thinking skills.

300/week is a tiny number"

AnthonyThe6reat,2015-03-02,"I know its usually this site where every moron thinks the vaccines are 100 percent perfect. It boggles my mind being injured and trying my absolute hardest to reason with them but they just will never hear it. I try and try to warn people and share my experience but it falls on deaf ears. I still share my story because I have every right to even if its means getting bad internet points lol. Hope your friends are doing okay, DM me if you want to hear what about any treatments they might want to try."
TisBeTheFuk,2018-05-01,I know / knew 4 people in my family who died from Covid. They were all unvaccinated. Two of them under 45 yo.
InformalYesterday760,2025-03-07,"The vaccines were absolutely shown to be safe


The likes of Joe Rogan have spread disinformation about it, but even their cited statistics turn out to be entirely backwards - the side effects they fear monger about are shown to be several times more likely to be found in someone recently infected with COVID than the vaccine. 

Ergo, the vaccines protected people against the same side effects people have tried to point to as examples for vaccines being dangerous."

WaltChamberlin,2012-09-26,Antivax losers and zerocovid losers are both suffering from very different types of brain rot. One thing I will say is that covid broke a ton of people's brains. Not directly because of the virus but because of the reaction to the virus.
eldonte,,What if it was shot up high school students? Does that still feel statistically insignificant? Lives matter.
diggerhistory,2016-05-13,The campaigns seek to remind people that it is safer to get the FREE vaccines - obviously reinforcing at no cost - and reminds them of the most at risk. Worked with me this year.
Educational-Side9940,2021-05-19,What do you consider an advertising campaign?  Because you are describing one and then saying it's not one.
Agreeable-Camera-382,2024-07-14,"So you're moving the goal posts to your out of scope rant? Sure. 

Yeah healthy people die. Very very very rare. Just like anything done in this field. So the fact you focus on such an outlier of a stat and think it's bigger than just selfish and stupid people not getting the vaccine is a mental block in you. Unless you have a lab and are an expert in this, maybe stop being a Dunning-Kruger"
CaptainAwesome06,2013-12-06,"A lot of ""healthy"" individuals fought for their lives during the height of COVID. I know this because my wife was treating them.

The biggest issue was that you didn't know what kind of case you were going to have. Sure, if you were young and healthy, you'd *probably* be fine. But why risk it when the vaccine was virtually harmless?

What we saw with VAERS was similar to what happens with autism. People get their 2-3 year old kids vaccinated and then all of a sudden their kid is unresponsive, etc. Did the vaccine give them autism? Of course not. That's just the age where autism gets diagnosed. Nobody is concerned when their 6 month old is non-verbal.

Correlation does not equal causation. The anti-vaccine crowd really struggles with this.

Also, 0.03% is still a lot higher than .0021%."
Chonngau,2021-04-29,"Think what you want. You are wrong. “The 18–45-y-o patients presented with pericarditis (2.2% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.003) and myocarditis (2.5% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.002) more frequently than patients >45 y/o.”

MFrancisWrites,2020-05-18,"If you are healthy, the chances of adverse side effect are also that much lower from the vaccine. It looks like you have the ability to gather reasonable data - what percentage of vaccinated people in that healthy bracket are you seeing hit by serious side effects? More or less than what you've cited for the virus? If I recall, when I went looking, it was significantly smaller by a factor of 8-10. This hold up? And if so, why ""take"" a chance ten times higher than another? What line of thinking makes that the better outcome, once you remove yourself from inference and conspiracy?"
Agreeable-Camera-382,2024-07-14,"Yes, they would be that much safer. The data is out there to prove such a fact. You, however, are not an expect in this field and don't have a lab to prove your misinformation."
Agreeable-Camera-382,2024-07-14,Lots of proof. Simple Google
Agreeable-Camera-382,2024-07-14,Kinda like when you visit Minneapolis... Google it and  you'll find out.

Educational-Side9940,2021-05-19,There are lots of TV ads and website ads about getting the both the flu and COVID vaccine especially when the flu shot comes out and when a new COVID booster comes out. You maybe zone them out but they are there.
Agreeable-Camera-382,2024-07-14,I see your messages are being deleted. Wonder why...
Agreeable-Camera-382,2024-07-14,"It is if that's your reasoning for not getting a vaccine. 

Thousand huh? Out of how many given? Do the math on that. 

All caps huh? You're mentally unstable."
