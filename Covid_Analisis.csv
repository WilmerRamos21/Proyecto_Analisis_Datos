Skiamakhos,2010-03-15,"The availability of vaccines tends to mean it's not such a big deal now. My mum was afraid to take the vaccine so when she had a fall & went into hospital for a dislocated metatarsal bone (lisfranc injury) & had to wait a week to be seen, she caught COVID while there. Her lungs failed. They put her on 7l/h of O2, then 14, but her lungs were a mess of blood clots and she died. This was after lockdown had finished & they weren't making a big fuss about COVID, but fully half the staff in that hospital were sick with COVID and off work. I've had all my shots & I haven't had COVID yet, but plenty of my friends have. It's like a bad 'flu, so they say, but if you're lucky that's it. 

That said... Long COVID is definitely a thing. Complications are definitely a thing. One of my friends is now on kidney dialysis 3x a week because of it. His kidneys got blood clots in them & failed. Another has had multiple strokes & finds it hard to work in his old role as a software developer. There is a significant risk of disability with this. Even with the vaccine, you've got a good chance of surviving but ending up with some debilitating disability.

They're not even counting the casualties these days though. If you can get your shots, take 'em. If you have it, stay indoors if you can, mask up if you have to go out. It hasn't gone anywhere, but the people in charge reckon profit is more important than people.",-0.07280844155844156,Negativo

Wearing a well fitting KN95, KF94, N95, FFP2, FFP3, CAN99, or P100 mask does a great deal to protect people from Covid because it is airborne. Airborne means it is produced simply by breathing, even by people with no symptoms, and lingers/moves in the air like smoke.

The_Wee-Donkey,2025-05-02,"It was a big deal because our healthcare systems couldn't cope with the number of severe cases, not because of the disease itself. When it first hit, it was spreading exponentially, and a sizeable number of those cases spent weeks in the hospital preventing the treatment of patients with other illnesses and conditions. 

The idea of socially isolating was to try and slow the spread of the disease, not to stop it altogether. If we could slow down the spread, we could delay people getting sick and therefore spread out the severe cases and give the hospitals a fighting chance to help care for all in need and not just the first ones through the door. Basically, instead of having x number of cases a week, it would be x number of cases a month, giving patients access to the resources . Of course, part of it was to protect the most vulnerable in our society by keeping the disease away from them where possible. 

Now, since the vaccine, the number of severe cases has reduced drastically. This is how vaccines work. They provide your own body with the tools it needs to fight off the infection, which greatly reduces the harsher symptoms. Now for most people a case of covid is like a cold/flu and while it might knock you on your ass, it is less likely to see you end up in hospital, meaning we don't need to keep socially isolated. 

However, like the flu, it can have bad years where the strain going around can be particularly nasty, giving rise to severe cases and may overwhelm hospitals again. We've thankfully not had a year where we've had to socially isolate again because flu is on the rise but you might hear doctors request people to get the vaccine to again slow spread and reduce case numbers.",-0.059195997239475495,Negativo

1) we have vaccines now, so if you get the vaccine you are less likely to get covid, or of you do you'll probably have more mild symptoms

2) a fast-evolving virus like this tends to become more mild over time.  The strains of covid that killed the host or even made them bedridden were less likely to get passed on to another person, whereas the strains you can still go to work with get passed around much more.  

3) the virus is much more spread out in time right now.  One of the biggest problems during the start of the pandemic was how fast it spread--so fast that new people were getting sock and needing hospital resources faster than the hospitals could keep up with.  Lots of people were dying that could have been saved if there was more room in hospitals.  You may remember ""flatten the curve"" as something people were saying at the time.  The meaning of that was to slow down the spread as much as possible, so that even if the same number of people overall got sick, they weren't all sick at the same time, and hospitals would have room to treat people as they got sick.

skiveman,2019-06-17,"I always thought that the main problem with Covid was that it really wasn't the virus that took you down and instead it lowered your bodies response to other new or pre-existing conditions to kill you. From the data I've seen and read it seems that most (I say most because it doesn't cover everyone) people who died were also suffering from (oftentimes) multiple other conditions that were exacerbated the Covid infection. In other words the Covid infection increased your vulnerability to compounding infections and illnesses. 

This is why, while I won't get another Covid vaccine myself due to the side effects I experienced, I did encourage my mother to get one as she has several underlying health conditions that could end her life in the event of a bad covid infection.

In young males/boys though there was an elevated risk in the earlier vaccine that did induce myocarditis. Which was most oftenly seen by the sheer number of young (and apparently) healthy male sportsmen having heart attacks on their various fields of play to such an extent that it was pretty common for a time when watching football (that's soccer to any Americans reading). This has pretty much become very uncommon as the vaccine that caused this was withdrawn and replaced with others that didn't cause this. 

Ultimately if you have underlying health conditions that are serious (say you've had a heart attack or stroke or diabetes) then you should seriously consider getting the vaccine.

As for being immune. No. The covid virus is a lot like the common cold virus in that it likes to mutate quite a bit which therefore makes a universal vaccine or your body to develop immunity to the virus difficult. What happens is that if you get infected then you might develop some resistance to that particular strain of the virus but otherwise you will remain fairly susceptible to new strains of the virus. Same with vaccines as they only target the most prevalent strains each year (hence yearly updated boosters) while they maybe teach your body how to fight similar(ish) strains but you will be susceptible to anything not covered in the booster.

It would be pretty absurd to say the “immunocompromised people are still vulnerable to HIV”, because HIV, like SARS-COV-2, *causes* damage, dysfunction, and immunocompromise!

The difference is that HIV is limited to the immune system can easily be tested, as well as treated, while SARS-COV-2 can fuck up *any* part of the body, cannot be easily tested for (because it’s not always in the blood), and there is no good treatment found yet.

*Every infection* fucks up something, even those with zero symptoms whatsoever, and every infection is another chance to get long-term, possibly permanent damage.

Losing sense of smell or taste (or having everything taste disgusting) is the most distinctive symptom, but people commonly lose abilities that they didn’t even know they had.

If you want to play Russian roulette, that’s up to you, though I certainly won’t be joining in!

Reminder that the mRNA vaccines only do anything for six months, after which time you’re worse off than before.

Definitely recommend Novavax if you can get it (which does *not* have this problem), though there’s no vaccine that can end this until they finally get an intranasal vaccine working in humans.

kammycakes,2016-07-04,"There’s a mix of truth and nonsense in this, but a lot of it’s either misleading or flat-out wrong. First off, HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are not “very similar” viruses. They’re both RNA viruses, sure, but that’s about where the similarity ends. HIV is a retrovirus that attacks and integrates into the immune system directly, while SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that hits multiple systems in the body but doesn’t embed itself in your DNA like HIV does.

It’s true that HIV can be asymptomatic for years, but trying to draw a 1:1 comparison with COVID isn’t accurate. They operate differently, spread differently, and impact the body differently. Saying it would be “absurd” to claim immunocompromised people are vulnerable to HIV because HIV causes immunocompromise makes zero sense. Being immunocompromised actually makes HIV worse if you get it, not irrelevant. As for testing, no, SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t “hide in the blood” or evade testing. We don’t test blood for it because it primarily infects the respiratory tract, and PCR and antigen tests work just fine when done correctly. HIV is tested via blood because it lives in blood cells. Totally different context.

The part about there being “no good treatment” for COVID is outdated. We have multiple treatments that reduce severity and prevent hospitalization, like Paxlovid and remdesivir. They’re not miracle cures, but they work and are widely available. The idea that every single SARS-CoV-2 infection causes lasting damage, even in asymptomatic cases, is overstated. Long COVID is real, and reinfections can carry risks, but not everyone who gets infected suffers permanent harm. That’s fear-mongering. It’s possible, not guaranteed.

The vaccine claim is just false. mRNA vaccines don’t “leave you worse off” after six months. Protection against infection does wane over time, but they still offer strong defense against hospitalization and death. Boosters help with that. Novavax is a solid option for people who don’t want mRNA, but it’s not magic either.

*In his 12 January 2022 episode, Rogan claimed the risk of myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) among vaccinated 12- to 17-year-olds was higher than the risk associated with catching Covid.

But his guest, the Australian broadcaster Josh Szeps, argued that, in fact, young males infected with the virus were up six times more likely to develop myocarditis as those who had received the vaccine. Szeps cited data from the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, suggesting a rate of about 450 myocarditis cases in every million Covid-19 infections among boys aged 12-17, compared with 77 cases a million after vaccination.

Separate data from 38.6 million people aged 16+ who were vaccinated in England identified an extra two to six myocarditis cases in every million people in the 28 days after receiving a first dose of the AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, and an extra 10 cases a million after a second dose of the Moderna vaccine.

This compared with an additional 40 cases a million people in the 28 days after a positive Covid test.*
